# 10.1 The Two-Terminal MOS Structure

or

\[
n_s = n_i \exp\left(\frac{\phi_s}{V_t}\right) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{\Delta \phi_s}{V_t}\right)
\]

(10.10b)

where \(\Delta \phi_s\) is the surface potential greater than \(2\phi_{fp}\).

We may note that

\[
n_{st} = n_i \exp\left(\frac{\phi_s}{V_t}\right)
\]

(10.11)

where \(n_{st}\) is the surface charge density at the threshold inversion point. The electron inversion charge density can then be written as

\[
n_s = n_{st} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta \phi_s}{V_t}\right)
\]

(10.12)

Figure 10.12 shows the electron inversion charge density as a function of surface potential for the case when the threshold inversion charge density is \(n_{st} = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\). We may note that the inversion charge density increases by a factor of 10 with a 60-mV increase in surface potential. As discussed previously, the electron inversion charge density increases rapidly with small increases in surface potential, which means that the space charge width essentially reaches a maximum value.
