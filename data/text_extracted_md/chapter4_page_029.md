**Figure 4.13** Energy-band diagram at \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \) for (a) n-type and (b) p-type semiconductors.

A detailed analysis, not given in this text, shows that at \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \), the Fermi energy is halfway between \( E_c \) and \( E_d \) for the n-type material and halfway between \( E_a \) and \( E_v \) for the p-type material. Figure 4.13 shows these effects. No electrons from the donor state are thermally elevated into the conduction band; this effect is called freeze-out. Similarly, when no electrons from the valence band are elevated into the acceptor states, the effect is also called freeze-out.

Between \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \), freeze-out, and \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), complete ionization, we have partial ionization of donor or acceptor atoms.

## EXAMPLE 4.8

**Objective:** Determine the temperature at which 90 percent of acceptor atoms are ionized.

Consider p-type silicon doped with boron at a concentration of \( N_a = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

### Solution

Find the ratio of holes in the acceptor state to the total number of holes in the valence band plus acceptor state. Taking into account the Boltzmann approximation and assuming the degeneracy factor is \( g = 4 \), we write

\[
\frac{p_s}{p_0 + p_s} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{N_v}{4N_a} \cdot \exp\left(\frac{- (E_a - E_v)}{kT}\right)}
\]
