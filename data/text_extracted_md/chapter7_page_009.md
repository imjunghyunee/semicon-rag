### 7.2.3 Space Charge Width

We can determine the distance that the space charge region extends into the p and n regions from the metallurgical junction. This distance is known as the space charge width. From Equation (7.17), we may write, for example,

\[
x_p = \frac{N_A x_n}{N_D}
\]

(7.27)

Then, substituting Equation (7.27) into Equation (7.26) and solving for \(x_n\), we obtain

\[
x_n = \left[ \frac{2 \varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{e} \left( \frac{N_A}{N_D} \right) \left( \frac{1}{N_A + N_D} \right) \right]^{1/2}
\]

(7.28)

Equation (7.28) gives the space charge width, or the width of the depletion region, \(x_n\), extending into the n-type region for the case of zero applied voltage.

Similarly, if we solve for \(x_p\) from Equation (7.17) and substitute into Equation (7.26), we find

\[
x_p = \left[ \frac{2 \varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{e} \left( \frac{N_D}{N_A} \right) \left( \frac{1}{N_A + N_D} \right) \right]^{1/2}
\]

(7.29)

where \(x_p\) is the width of the depletion region extending into the p region for the case of zero applied voltage.

The total depletion or space charge width \(W\) is the sum of the two components, or

\[
W = x_n + x_p
\]

(7.30)

Using Equations (7.28) and (7.29), we obtain

\[
W = \left[ \frac{2 \varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{e} \left( \frac{N_A + N_D}{N_A N_D} \right) \right]^{1/2}
\]
