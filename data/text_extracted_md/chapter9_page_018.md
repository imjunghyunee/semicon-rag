# CHAPTER 9 Metal–Semiconductor and Semiconductor Heterojunctions

## Comment

A comparison of the two forward-bias voltages shows that the Schottky barrier diode has a turn-on voltage that, in this case, is approximately 0.37 V smaller than the turn-on voltage of the pn junction diode.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex. 9.6** A pn junction diode and a Schottky diode have equal cross-sectional areas and have forward-bias currents of 0.5 mA. The reverse-saturation current of the Schottky diode is \(5 \times 10^{-7}\) A. The difference in forward-bias voltage between the two diodes is 0.30 V. Determine the reverse-saturation current of the pn junction diode.

\[
(V_{t} = 0.1 \times 99^{\circ} \text{F} \approx 5 \text{UV})
\]

The actual difference between the turn-on voltages will be a function of the barrier height of the metal–semiconductor contact and the doping concentrations in the pn junction, but the relatively large difference will always be realized. We will consider one application that utilizes the difference in turn-on voltage in Chapter 12, in what is referred to as a **Schottky clamped transistor**.

The second major difference between a Schottky barrier diode and a pn junction diode is in the frequency response, or switching characteristics. In our discussion, we have considered the current in a Schottky diode as being due to the injection of majority carriers over a potential barrier. The energy-band diagram of Figure 9.1, for example, shows that there can be electrons in the metal directly adjacent to empty states in the semiconductor. If an electron from the valence band of the semiconductor were to flow into the metal, this effect would be equivalent to holes being injected into the semiconductor. This injection of holes would create excess minority carrier holes in the n region. However, calculations as well as measurements have shown that the ratio of the minority carrier hole current to the total current is extremely low in most cases.

The Schottky barrier diode, then, is a majority carrier device. This fact means that there is no diffusion capacitance associated with a forward-biased Schottky diode. The elimination of the diffusion capacitance makes the Schottky diode a higher-frequency device than the pn junction diode. Also, when switching a Schottky diode from forward to reverse bias, there is no minority carrier stored charge to remove, as is the case in the pn junction diode. Since there is no minority carrier storage time, the Schottky diodes can be used in fast-switching applications. A typical switching time for a Schottky diode is in the picosecond range, while for a pn junction it is normally in the nanosecond range.

## TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

(a) The reverse-saturation currents of a pn junction and a Schottky diode are \(10^{-14}\) A and \(10^{-7}\) A, respectively. Determine the required forward-bias voltages in the pn junction diode and Schottky diode to produce a current of 100 μA in each diode. (b) Repeat part (a) for forward bias currents of 1 mA.
