### 4.2 Dopant Atoms and Energy Levels

The analysis begins by setting the coulomb force of attraction between the electron and ion equal to the centripetal force of the orbiting electron. This condition will give a steady orbit. We have

\[
\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon r} = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

(4.27)

where \( v \) is the magnitude of the velocity and \( r \) is the radius of the orbit. If we assume the angular momentum is also quantized, then we can write

\[
m^* r_n v = n\hbar
\]

(4.28)

where \( n \) is a positive integer. Solving for \( v \) from Equation (4.28), substituting into Equation (4.27), and solving for the radius, we obtain

\[
r_n = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2 4\pi \varepsilon}{m^* e^2}
\]

(4.29)

The assumption of the angular momentum being quantized leads to the radius also being quantized.

The Bohr radius is defined as

\[
a_0 = \frac{4\pi \varepsilon \hbar^2}{m_0 e^2} = 0.53 \, \text{Å}
\]

(4.30)

We can normalize the radius of the donor orbital to that of the Bohr radius, which gives

\[
\frac{r_n}{a_0} = n^2 \varepsilon_r \left( \frac{m_0}{m^*} \right)
\]

(4.31)

where \( \varepsilon_r \) is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor material, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of an electron, and \( m^* \) is the conductivity effective mass of the electron in the semiconductor. 

If we consider the lowest energy state in which \( n = 1 \) and if we consider silicon in which \( \varepsilon_r = 11.7 \) and the conductivity effective mass is \( m^*/m_0 = 0.26 \), then we have that

\[
\frac{r_1}{a_0} = 45
\]

(4.32)

or \( r_1 = 23.9 \, \text{Å} \). This radius corresponds to approximately four lattice constants of silicon. Recall that one unit cell in silicon effectively contains eight atoms, so the radius of the orbiting donor electron encompasses many silicon atoms. The donor electron is not tightly bound to the donor atom.

The total energy of the orbiting electron is given by

\[
E = T + V
\]

(4.33)

where \( T \) is the kinetic energy and \( V \) is the potential energy of the electron. The kinetic energy is

\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m^* v^2
\]

(4.34)
