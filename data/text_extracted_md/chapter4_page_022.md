# 4.3 The Extrinsic Semiconductor

so that the thermal-equilibrium electron concentration can be written as

\[
n_0 = n_i \exp \left( \frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \right)
\]

(4.39)

Similarly, if we add and subtract an intrinsic Fermi energy in the exponent of Equation (4.19), we will obtain

\[
p_0 = n_i \exp \left( \frac{-(E_F - E_{Fi})}{kT} \right)
\]

(4.40)

As we will see, the Fermi level changes when donors and acceptors are added, but Equations (4.39) and (4.40) show that, as the Fermi level changes from the intrinsic Fermi level, \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) change from the \( n_i \) value. If \( E_F > E_{Fi} \), then we will have \( n_0 > n_i \) and \( p_0 < n_i \). One characteristic of an n-type semiconductor is that \( E_F > E_{Fi} \) so that \( n_0 > p_0 \). Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, \( E_F < E_{Fi} \) so that \( p_0 > n_i \) and \( p_0 < n_i \); thus, \( p_0 > n_0 \).

We can see the functional dependence of \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) with \( E_F \) in Figures 4.8 and 4.9. As \( E_F \) moves above or below \( E_{Fi} \), the overlapping probability function with the density of states functions in the conduction band and valence band changes. As \( E_F \) moves above \( E_{Fi} \), the probability function in the conduction band increases, while the probability, \( 1 - f_F(E) \), of an empty state (hole) in the valence band decreases. As \( E_F \) moves below \( E_{Fi} \), the opposite occurs.

## 4.3.2 The \( n_0 p_0 \) Product

We may take the product of the general expressions for \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) as given in Equations (4.11) and (4.19), respectively. The result is

\[
n_0 p_0 = N_c N_v \exp \left( \frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT} \right) \exp \left( \frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT} \right)
\]

(4.41)

which may be written as

\[
n_0 p_0 = N_c N_v \exp \left( \frac{-E_g}{kT} \right)
\]

(4.42)

As Equation (4.42) was derived for a general value of Fermi energy, the values of \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) are not necessarily equal. However, Equation (4.42) is exactly the same as Equation (4.23), which we derived for the case of an intrinsic semiconductor. We then have that, for the semiconductor in thermal equilibrium,

\[
n_0 p_0 = n_i^2
\]

(4.43)

Equation (4.43) states that the product of \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) is always a constant for a given semiconductor material at a given temperature. Although this equation seems
