which shows that the specific contact resistance is a very strong function of semiconductor doping.

Figure 9.15 shows a plot of the theoretical values of \( R_c \) as a function of semiconductor doping. For doping concentrations greater than approximately \( 10^{19} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), the tunneling process dominates and \( R_c \) shows the exponential dependence on \( N_D \). For lower doping concentrations, the \( R_c \) values are dependent on the barrier heights and become almost independent of the doping. Also shown in the figure are experimental data for platinum silicide–silicon and aluminum–silicon junctions.

Equation (9.33) is the specific contact resistance of the tunneling junction, which corresponds to the metal–\( n^+ \) contact shown in Figure 9.14. However, the \( n^+n \) junction also has a specific contact resistance, since there is a barrier associated with this junction. For a fairly low doped \( n \) region, this contact resistance may actually dominate the total resistance of the junction.

The theory of forming ohmic contacts is straightforward. To form a good ohmic contact, we need to create a low barrier and use a highly doped semiconductor at the surface. However, the actual technology of fabricating good, reliable ohmic contacts is not as easy in practice as in theory. It is also more difficult to fabricate good ohmic contacts on wide-bandgap materials. In general, low barriers are not possible on these materials, so a heavily doped semiconductor at the surface must be used to form a tunneling contact. The formation of a tunneling junction requires diffusion, ion implantation, or perhaps epitaxial growth. The surface doping concentration in
