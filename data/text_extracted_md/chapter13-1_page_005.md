**Figure 13.4** Gate-to-channel space charge regions and \( I \)â€“\( V \) characteristics for zero gate voltage and for (a) a small drain voltage, (b) a larger drain voltage, and (c) a drain voltage to achieve pinchoff at the drain terminal.

Figure 13.5 shows an expanded view of the pinchoff region in the channel. The n channel and drain terminal are now separated by a space charge region which has a length \(\Delta L\). The electrons move through the n channel from the source and are injected into the space charge region where, subjected to the E-field force, they are swept through into the drain contact area. If we assume that \(\Delta L \ll L\), then the electric field in the n-channel region remains unchanged from the \(V_{DS}(sat)\) case; the drain current will remain constant as \(V_{DS}\) changes. Once the carriers are in the drain region, the current remains constant.
