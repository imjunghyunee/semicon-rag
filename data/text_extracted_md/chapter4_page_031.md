# 4.5.2 Equilibrium Electron and Hole Concentrations

!Energy-band diagram of a compensated semiconductor

**Figure 4.14** Energy-band diagram of a compensated semiconductor showing ionized and un-ionized donors and acceptors.

Figure 4.14 shows the energy-band diagram of a semiconductor when both donor and acceptor impurity atoms are added to the same region to form a compensated semiconductor. The figure shows how the electrons and holes can be distributed among the various states.

The charge neutrality condition is expressed by equating the density of negative charges to the density of positive charges. We then have

\[
n_0 + N_D^+ = p_0 + N_A^-
\]

(4.56)

or

\[
n_0 + (N_D - n_d) = p_0 + (N_A - n_a)
\]

(4.57)

where \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) are the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. The parameter \( n_d \) is the concentration of electrons in the donor energy states, so \( N_D^+ = N_D - n_d \) is the concentration of positively charged donor states. Similarly, \( p_a \) is the concentration of holes in the acceptor states, so \( N_A^- = N_A - p_a \) is the concentration of negatively charged acceptor states. We have expressions for \( n_0, p_0, n_d, \) and \( p_a \) in terms of the Fermi energy and temperature.
