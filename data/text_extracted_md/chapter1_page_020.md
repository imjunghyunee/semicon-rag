# 1.8 Summary

- A few of the most common semiconductor materials were listed. Silicon is the most common semiconductor material and appears in column IV of the periodic table.
- The properties of semiconductors and other materials are determined to a large extent by the single-crystal lattice structure. The unit cell is a small volume of the crystal that is used to reproduce the entire crystal. Three basic unit cells are the simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic.
- Silicon has the diamond crystal structure. Atoms are formed in a tetrahedral configuration with four nearest neighbor atoms. The binary semiconductors have a zincblende lattice that is basically the same as the diamond lattice.
- Miller indices are used to describe planes in a crystal lattice. These planes may be used to describe the surface of a semiconductor material. The Miller indices are also used to describe directions in a crystal.
- Imperfections do exist in semiconductor materials. A few of these imperfections are vacancies, substitutional impurities, and interstitial impurities. Small amounts of controlled substitutional impurities can favorably alter semiconductor properties as we will see in later chapters.
- A brief description of semiconductor growth methods was given. Bulk growth, such as the Czochralski method, produces the starting semiconductor material or substrate. Epitaxial growth can be used to control the surface properties of a semiconductor. Most semiconductor devices are fabricated in the epitaxial layer.
