from the base so that the amount of excess stored charge in the base and collector is drastically reduced. The excess minority carrier concentration in the base and collector at the B–C junction is an exponential function of \( V_{BC} \). If \( V_{BC} \) is reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 V, for example, the excess minority carrier concentration is reduced by over three orders of magnitude. The reduced excess stored charge in the base of the Schottky transistor greatly reduces the storage time—storage times on the order of 1 ns or less are common in Schottky transistors.

## *12.8 | Other Bipolar Transistor Structures

This section is intended to briefly introduce three specialized bipolar transistor structures. The first structure is the polysilicon emitter bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the second is the SiGe-base transistor, and the third is the heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). The polysilicon emitter BJT is being used in some recent integrated circuits, and the SiGe-base transistor and HBT are intended for high-frequency/high-speed applications.

### 12.8.1 Polysilicon Emitter BJT

The emitter injection efficiency is degraded by the carriers injected from the base back into the emitter. The emitter width, in general, is thin, which increases speed and reduces parasitic resistance. However, a thin emitter increases the gradient in the minority carrier concentration, as indicated in Figure 12.19. The increase in the gradient increases the B–E junction current, which in turn decreases the emitter injection efficiency and decreases the common-emitter current gain. This effect is also shown in the summary of Table 12.3.

Figure 12.46 shows the idealized cross section of an npn bipolar transistor with a polysilicon emitter. As shown in the figure, there is a very thin \( n^+ \) single-crystal silicon region between the p-type base and the n-type polysilicon. As a first approximation to the analysis, we may treat the polysilicon portion of the emitter as low-mobility silicon, which means that the corresponding diffusion coefficient is small.
