The conduction band tends to settle at the minimum conduction band energy that is at \( k = 0 \). Similarly, holes in the valence band tend to congregate at the uppermost valence band energy. In GaAs, the minimum conduction band energy and maximum valence band energy occur at the same \( k \) value. A semiconductor with this property is said to be a **direct bandgap semiconductor**; transitions between the two allowed bands can take place with no change in crystal momentum. This direct nature has a significant effect on the optical properties of the material. GaAs and other direct bandgap materials are ideally suited for use in semiconductor lasers and other optical devices.

The \( E \) versus \( k \) diagram for silicon is shown in Figure 3.25b. The maximum in the valence band energy occurs at \( k = 0 \) as before. The minimum in the conduction band energy occurs not at \( k = 0 \), but along the [100] direction. The difference between the minimum conduction band energy and the maximum valence band energy is still defined as the bandgap energy \( E_g \). A semiconductor whose maximum valence band energy and minimum conduction band energy do not occur at the same \( k \) value is called an **indirect bandgap semiconductor**. When electrons make a transition between the conduction and valence bands, we must invoke the law of conservation of momentum. A transition in an indirect bandgap material must necessarily include an interaction with the crystal so that crystal momentum is conserved.

**Germanium is also an indirect bandgap material**, whose valence band maximum occurs at \( k = 0 \) and whose conduction band minimum occurs along the [111] direction. GaAs is a direct bandgap semiconductor, but other compound semiconductors, such as GaP and AlAs, have indirect bandgaps.
