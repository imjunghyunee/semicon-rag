The point is that, in thermal equilibrium, the Fermi energy level is a constant throughout a system. We will not prove this statement, but we can intuitively see its validity by considering the following example.

Suppose we have a particular material, A, whose electrons are distributed in the energy states of an allowed band as shown in Figure 4.20a. Most of the energy states below \( E_F \) contain electrons and most of the energy states above \( E_F \) are empty of electrons. Consider another material, B, whose electrons are distributed in the energy states of an allowed band as shown in Figure 4.20b. The energy states below \( E_F \) are mostly full and the energy states above \( E_F \) are mostly empty. If these two materials are brought into intimate contact, the electrons in the entire system will tend to seek the lowest possible energy. Electrons from material A will flow into the lower energy states of material B, as indicated in Figure 4.20c, until thermal equilibrium is reached. Thermal equilibrium occurs when the distribution of electrons, as a function of energy, is the same in the two materials. This equilibrium state occurs when the Fermi energy is the same in the two materials as shown in Figure 4.20d. The Fermi energy, important in the physics of the semiconductor, also provides a good pictorial representation of the characteristics of the semiconductor materials and devices.

## TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 4.14** Determine the position of the Fermi level with respect to the valence-band energy in p-type GaAs at \( T = 300 \, K \). The doping concentrations are \( N_d = 5 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( N_a = 4 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). (\( \Lambda P \langle 0 \rangle = -q \langle 3q \rangle \))

**TYU 4.15** Calculate the position of the Fermi energy level in n-type silicon at \( T = 300 \, K \) with respect to the intrinsic Fermi energy level. The doping concentrations are \( N_d = 2 \times 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( N_a = 3 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). (\( \Lambda P \langle 0 \rangle = -q \langle 3q \rangle \))
