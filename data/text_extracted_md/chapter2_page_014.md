# Chapter 2: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

If the function solution \(\psi(x)\) is a real function, then \(\psi(x) = \psi^*(x)\). Substituting the wave function into Equation (2.18), we have

\[
\int_0^a A_2^2 \sin^2 kx \, dx = 1
\]

(2.34)

Evaluating this integral gives

\[
A_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}
\]

(2.35)

Finally, the time-independent wave solution is given by

\[
\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{a} \right) \quad \text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
\]

(2.36)

This solution represents the electron in the infinite potential well and is a standing wave solution. The free electron was represented by a traveling wave, and now the bound particle is represented by a standing wave.

The parameter \(k\) in the wave solution was defined by Equations (2.30) and (2.33). Equating these two expressions for \(k\), we obtain

\[
k^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2} = \frac{n^2 \pi^2}{a^2}
\]

(2.37)

The total energy can then be written as

\[
E = E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 n^2 \pi^2}{2ma^2} \quad \text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
\]

(2.38)

For the particle in the infinite potential well, the wave function is now given by

\[
\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin k_n x
\]

(2.39)

where the constant \(k_n\), from Equation (2.37), must have discrete values, implying that the total energy of the particle can only have discrete values. This result means that the energy of the particle is quantized. That is, the energy of the particle can only have particular discrete values. The quantization of the particle energy is contrary to results from classical physics, which would allow the particle to have continuous energy values. The discrete energies lead to quantum states that will be considered in more detail in this and later chapters. The quantization of the energy of a bound particle is an important result.

This quantization of electron energy will be observed again at the end of the chapter for an electron bound to an ion forming an atom.

^3 A more thorough analysis shows that \(|A_2| = \sqrt{2/a}\), so solutions for the coefficient \(A\) include \(+\sqrt{2/a}, -\sqrt{2/a}, +i\sqrt{2/a}, -i\sqrt{2/a}\), or any complex number whose magnitude is \(\sqrt{2/a}\). Since the wave function itself has no physical meaning, the choice of which coefficient to use is immaterial: They all produce the same probability density function.
