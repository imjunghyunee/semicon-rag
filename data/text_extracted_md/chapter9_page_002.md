# 9.1 The Schottky Barrier Diode

One of the first practical semiconductor devices used in the early 1900s was the metal–semiconductor diode. This diode, also called a **point contact diode**, was made by touching a metallic whisker to an exposed semiconductor surface. These metal–semiconductor diodes were not easily reproduced or mechanically reliable and were replaced by the pn junction in the 1950s. However, semiconductor and vacuum technology is now used to fabricate reproducible and reliable metal–semiconductor contacts. In this section, we consider the metal–semiconductor rectifying contact, or Schottky barrier diode. In most cases, the rectifying contacts are made on n-type semiconductors; for this reason, we concentrate on this type of diode.

## 9.1.1 Qualitative Characteristics

The ideal energy-band diagram for a particular metal and n-type semiconductor before making contact is shown in Figure 9.1a. The vacuum level is used as a reference level. The parameter \( \phi_m \) is the metal work function (measured in volts), \( \Phi \), is
