(After Sze [14].)

We may plot the carrier concentration and conductivity of a semiconductor as a function of temperature for a particular doping concentration. Figure 5.6 shows the electron concentration and conductivity of silicon as a function of inverse temperature for the case when \( N_d = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). In the midtemperature range, or extrinsic range, as shown, we have complete ionizationâ€”the electron concentration remains essentially constant. However, the mobility is a function of temperature so the conductivity varies with temperature in this range. At higher temperatures, the intrinsic carrier concentration increases and begins to dominate the electron concentration as well as the conductivity. In the lower temperature range, freeze-out begins to occur; the electron concentration and conductivity decrease with decreasing temperature.

**Objective:** Determine the doping concentration and majority carrier mobility given the type and conductivity of a compensated semiconductor

**Example 5.3**

Consider compensated n-type silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), with a conductivity of \( \sigma = 16 \, (\Omega \, \text{cm})^{-1} \) and an acceptor doping concentration of \( 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Determine the donor concentration and the electron mobility.

**Solution**

For n-type silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), we can assume complete ionization; therefore the conductivity, assuming \( N_d - N_a \gg n_i \), is given by

\[
\sigma = e \mu_n n = e \mu_n (N_d - N_a)
\]

We have that

\[
16 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \mu_n (N_d - 10^{17})
\]
