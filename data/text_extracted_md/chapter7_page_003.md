## 7.2 Zero Applied Bias

**depletion region**; these two terms will be used interchangeably. Density gradients still exist in the majority carrier concentrations at each edge of the space charge region. We can think of a density gradient as producing a "diffusion force" that acts on the majority carriers. These diffusion forces, acting on the electrons and holes at the edges of the space charge region, are shown in the figure. The electric field in the space charge region produces another force on the electrons and holes, which is in the opposite direction to the diffusion force for each type of particle. In thermal equilibrium, the diffusion force and the E-field force exactly balance each other.

### 7.2.1 Zero Applied Bias

We have considered the basic pn junction structure and discussed briefly how the space charge region is formed. In this section we will examine the properties of the step junction in thermal equilibrium, where no currents exist and no external excitation is applied. We will determine the space charge region width, electric field, and potential through the depletion region.

The analysis in this chapter is based on two assumptions that we have considered in previous chapters. The first assumption is that the Boltzmann approximation is valid, which means that each semiconductor region is nondegenerately doped. The second assumption is that complete ionization exists, which means that the temperature of the pn junction is not "too low."

#### 7.2.1 Built-in Potential Barrier

If we assume that no voltage is applied across the pn junction, then the junction is in thermal equilibriumâ€”the Fermi energy level is constant throughout the entire system. Figure 7.3 shows the energy-band diagram for the pn junction in thermal equilibrium. The conduction and valence band energies must bend as we go through the space charge region, since the relative position of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the Fermi energy changes between p and n regions.

- \( E_c \) and \( E_v \) represent the conduction and valence band energies.
- \( E_{Fp} \) and \( E_{Fn} \) are the Fermi energy levels in the p and n regions.
- \( eV_0 \) is the built-in potential barrier.
- \( e\phi_{Fp} \) and \( e\phi_{Fn} \) are the energy differences between the Fermi level and the intrinsic level in the p and n regions, respectively.
