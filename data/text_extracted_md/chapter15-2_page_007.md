!SCR Circuit Diagram

**Figure 15.35** (a) Simple SCR circuit. (b) Input AC voltage signal and trigger pulse. (c) Output voltage versus time.

A four-layer device by generating electron–hole pairs, particularly in the \( J_2 \) junction, producing a photocurrent. The photocurrent is equivalent to a gate current in an SCR so the parasitic device can be switched into its conducting state. Again, once the device is switched on, it will remain in its conducting state even when the radiation ceases. An optical signal can also trigger the device in the same manner by generating electron–hole pairs.

Another triggering mechanism in the npnp device is \( dV/dt \) triggering. If the forward-bias anode voltage is applied rapidly, the voltage across the \( J_2 \) junction will also change quickly. This changing reverse-biased \( J_2 \) junction voltage means that the space charge region width is increasing; thus, electrons are being removed from the \( n_1 \) side of the junction and holes are being removed from the \( p_2 \) side of the junction.
