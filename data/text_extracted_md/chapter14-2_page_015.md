## EXAMPLE 14.9

**Objective:** Calculate the critical angle at a semiconductor–air interface. Consider the interface between GaAs and air.

### Solution

For GaAs, \( n_2 = 3.8 \) at a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.70 \, \mu m \) and for air, \( n_1 = 1.0 \). The critical angle is

\[
\theta_c = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \right) = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1.0}{3.8} \right) = 15.3^\circ
\]

### Comment

Any photon that is incident at an angle greater than 15.3° will be reflected back into the semiconductor.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 14.9** Repeat Example 14.9 for GaAs\(_{0.5}\)P\(_{0.4}\). See Exercise Problem Ex 14.8 for a discussion of the dielectric constant.

Figure 14.28a shows the external quantum efficiency plotted as a function of the p-type doping concentration and Figure 14.28b is a plot of the external efficiency as a function of junction depth below the surface. Both figures show that the external quantum efficiency is in the range of 1 to 3 percent.

## 14.5.4 LED Devices

The wavelength of the output signal of an LED is determined by the bandgap energy of the semiconductor. Gallium arsenide, a direct bandgap material, has a bandgap energy of \( E_g = 1.42 \, \text{eV} \), which yields a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.873 \, \mu m \). Comparing this wavelength to the visible spectrum, which is shown in Figure 14.5, the output...
