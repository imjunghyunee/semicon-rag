# 14.3 PHOTODETECTORS

There are several semiconductor devices that can be used to detect the presence of photons. These devices are known as photodetectors; they convert optical signals into electrical signals. When excess electrons and holes are generated in a semiconductor, there is an increase in the conductivity of the material. This change in conductivity is the basis of the photoconductor, perhaps the simplest type of photodetector. If electrons and holes are generated within the space charge region of a pn junction, then they will be separated by the electric field and a current will be produced. The pn junction is the basis of several photodetector devices including the photodiode and the phototransistor.

## 14.3.1 Photoconductor

Figure 14.16 shows a bar of semiconductor material with ohmic contacts at each end and a voltage applied between the terminals. The initial thermal-equilibrium conductivity is

\[
\sigma_0 = e[\mu_n n_0 + \mu_p p_0]
\]

(14.17)

If excess carriers are generated in the semiconductor, the conductivity becomes

\[
\sigma = e[\mu_n(n_0 + \delta n) + \mu_p(p_0 + \delta p)]
\]

(14.18)

where \(\delta n\) and \(\delta p\) are the excess electron and hole concentrations, respectively. If we consider an n-type semiconductor, then, from charge neutrality, we can assume that
