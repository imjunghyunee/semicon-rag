# CHAPTER 6 Non-equilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

and

\[
\delta n(x) = \delta n(0)e^{x/L_n} \quad x \leq 0
\]
(6.65b)

where \(\delta n(0)\) is the value of the excess electron concentration at \(x = 0\). The steady-state excess electron concentration decays exponentially with distance away from the source at \(x = 0\).

## Comment

We may note that the steady-state excess concentration decays to \(1/e\) of its value at \(x = L_n\).

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 6.4** In Example 6.4, consider p-type silicon at \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\) doped to \(N_a = 5 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\). Assume that \(\tau_n = 5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}\), \(D_n = 25 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}\), and \(\delta n(0) = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\). (a) Calculate the value of diffusion length \(L_n\). (b) Determine \(\delta n\) at (i) \(x = 0\), (ii) \(x = +30 \, \mu\text{m}\), (iii) \(x = -50 \, \mu\text{m}\), (iv) \(x = +85 \, \mu\text{m}\), and (v) \(x = -120 \, \mu\text{m}\).

As before, we will assume charge neutrality; thus, the steady-state excess majority carrier hole concentration also decays exponentially with distance with the same characteristic minority carrier electron diffusion length \(L_n\). Figure 6.7 is a plot of the total electron and hole concentrations as a function of distance. We are assuming low injection, that is, \(\delta n(0) \ll p_0\) in the p-type semiconductor. The total concentration of
