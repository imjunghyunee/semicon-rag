# 11.6 | SUMMARY

- Advanced concepts of MOSFETs have been discussed in this chapter.
- Subthreshold conduction means that the drain current in a MOSFET is not zero even when the gate-to-source voltage is less than the threshold voltage. In this situation, the transistor is based in the weak inversion mode and the drain current is dominated by the diffusion rather than the drift mechanism.
- The effective channel length decreases with an increase in drain voltage when the MOSFET is biased in the saturation region, since the depletion region at the drain extends into the channel. This effect is known as channel length modulation.
- The mobility of carriers in the inversion layer is not a constant. As the gate voltage increases, the transverse electric field at the oxide interface increases, causing additional surface scattering. The increased carrier scattering leads to a reduced mobility and a deviation from the ideal currentâ€“voltage relation.
- As the channel length decreases, the lateral electric field increases so that carriers flowing through the channel may reach their saturation velocity. In this case, the drain current becomes a linear function of gate-to-source voltage.
- The tendency in MOSFET design is to make devices smaller. The principle of constant-field scaling has been discussed.
- Modification in threshold voltage as device dimensions shrink has been discussed.
- Because of charge-sharing effects in the substrate, the threshold voltage decreases as channel length decreases and increases as channel width decreases.
- Several voltage breakdown mechanisms have been discussed. These include oxide breakdown, avalanche breakdown, near avalanche or snapback breakdown, and near punch-through effects. These mechanisms are all enhanced as device dimensions shrink.
- The lightly doped drain transistor tends to minimize the drain breakdown effects.
- Ion implantation can be used as essentially a final process step to change and adjust the substrate doping in the channel region to provide the desired threshold voltage. This process is referred to as threshold voltage adjustment by ion implantation and is used extensively in device fabrication.
- The effect of ionization radiation and hot-electron effects on MOSFET behavior have been briefly discussed.

# GLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS

- **channel length modulation**  
  The change in effective channel length with drain-to-source voltage when the MOSFET is biased in saturation.

- **drain-induced barrier lowering**  
  The near punch-through condition in which the potential barrier between the source and channel region in an off transistor is lowered due to a large applied drain voltage.

- **hot electrons**  
  Electrons with energies far greater than the thermal-equilibrium value caused by acceleration in high electric fields.

- **lightly doped drain (LDD)**  
  A MOSFET with a lightly doped drain region adjacent to the channel to reduce voltage breakdown effects.

- **narrow-channel effects**  
  The shift in threshold voltage as the channel width narrows.

- **near punch-through**  
  The reduction in the potential barrier between source and substrate by the drain-to-substrate voltage, resulting in a rapid increase in drain current.

- **short-channel effects**  
  The shift in threshold voltage as the channel length becomes smaller.
