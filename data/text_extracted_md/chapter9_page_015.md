## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 9.4** Calculate the ideal Richardson constant for a free electron.  
\[
\left( \frac{uW-xL}{V \, OI} = a \, v^r \, sUV \right)
\]

We may note that the reverse-saturation current densities of the tungsten–silicon and tungsten–gallium arsenide diodes in Figure 9.9 differ by approximately two orders of magnitude. This two order of magnitude difference will be reflected in the effective Richardson constant, assuming the barrier heights in the two diodes are essentially the same. The definition of the effective Richardson constant, given by Equation (9.24), contains the electron effective mass, which differs substantially between silicon and gallium arsenide. The fact that the effective mass is in the expression for the Richardson constant is a direct result of using the effective density of states function in the thermionic emission theory. The net result is that \( A^* \) and \( J_{sr} \) will vary widely between silicon and gallium arsenide.

### 9.1.5 Comparison of the Schottky Barrier Diode and the pn Junction Diode

Although the ideal current–voltage relationship of the Schottky barrier diode given by Equation (9.25) is of the same form as that of the pn junction diode, there are two important differences between a Schottky diode and a pn junction diode: The first is in the magnitudes of the reverse-saturation current densities and the second is in the switching characteristics.
