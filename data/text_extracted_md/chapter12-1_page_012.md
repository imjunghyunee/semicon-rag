## 12.2.1 Forward-Active Mode

Consider a uniformly doped npn bipolar transistor with the geometry shown in Figure 12.13. When we consider the individual emitter, base, and collector regions, we shift the origin to the edge of the space charge region and consider a positive \( x, x', \) or \( x'' \) coordinate as shown in the figure.

In the forward-active mode, the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C is reverse biased. We expect the minority carrier distributions to look like those shown.
