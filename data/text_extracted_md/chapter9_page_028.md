The qualitative distribution of electrons in the potential well is shown in Figure 9.21. A current parallel to the interface will be a function of this electron concentration and of the electron mobility. Since the GaAs can be lightly doped or intrinsic, the two-dimensional electron gas is in a region of low impurity doping so that impurity scattering effects are minimized. The electron mobility will be much larger than if the electrons were in the same region as the ionized donors.

The movement of the electrons parallel to the interface will still be influenced by the coulomb attraction of the ionized impurities in the AlGaAs. The effect of these forces can be further reduced by using a graded AlGaAs–GaAs heterojunction. The graded layer is Al\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)As in which the mole fraction \(x\) varies with distance. In this case, an intrinsic layer of graded AlGaAs can be sandwiched between the N-type AlGaAs and the intrinsic GaAs. Figure 9.22 shows the conduction-band edges across a graded AlGaAs–GaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. The electrons in the potential well are further separated from the ionized impurities so that the electron mobility is increased above that in an abrupt heterojunction.

## 9.3.4 Equilibrium Electrostatics

We now consider the electrostatics of the nP heterojunction that is shown in Figure 9.18. As in the case of the homojunction, potential differences exist across the space charge regions in both the n region and the P region. These potential differences correspond to the built-in potential barriers on either side of the junction. The built-in potential barrier for this ideal case is defined as shown in Figure 9.18 to be the potential difference across the vacuum level. The built-in potential barrier is the sum of the potential differences across each of the space charge regions. The heterojunction built-in potential barrier, however, is not equal to the difference between the conduction bands across the junction or the difference between the valence bands across the junction, as we defined for the homojunction.

Ideally, the total built-in potential barrier \(V_{bi}\) can be found as the difference between the work functions, or

\[
V_{bi} = \phi_p - \phi_n
\]
