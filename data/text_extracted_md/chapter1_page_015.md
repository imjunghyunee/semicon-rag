Geometric arrangement of atoms broken but also the ideal chemical bonding between atoms is disrupted, which tends to change the electrical properties of the material. A vacancy and interstitial may be in close enough proximity to exhibit an interaction between the two point defects. This vacancyâ€“interstitial defect, also known as a **Frenkel defect**, produces different effects than the simple vacancy or interstitial.

The point defects involve single atoms or single-atom locations. In forming single-crystal materials, more complex defects may occur. A line defect, for example, occurs when an entire row of atoms is missing from its normal lattice site. This defect is referred to as a **line dislocation** and is shown in Figure 1.19. As with a point defect, a line dislocation disrupts both the normal geometric periodicity of the lattice and the ideal atomic bonds in the crystal. This dislocation can also alter the electrical properties of the material, usually in a more unpredictable manner than the simple point defects.

Other complex dislocations can also occur in a crystal lattice. However, this introductory discussion is intended only to present a few of the basic types of defect, and to show that a real crystal is not necessarily a perfect lattice structure. The effect of these imperfections on the electrical properties of a semiconductor will be considered in later chapters.
