The crystal. The "empty" position associated with the boron atom becomes occupied, and other valence electron positions become vacated. These other vacated electron positions can be thought of as holes in the semiconductor material.

Figure 4.7 shows the expected energy state of the "empty" position and also the formation of a hole in the valence band. The hole can move through the crystal generating a current, while the negatively charged boron atom is fixed in the crystal. The group III atom accepts an electron from the valence band and so is referred to as an **acceptor impurity atom**. The acceptor atom can generate holes in the valence band without generating electrons in the conduction band. This type of semiconductor material is referred to as a **p type material** (p for the positively charged hole).

The pure single-crystal semiconductor material is called an intrinsic material. Adding controlled amounts of dopant atoms, either donors or acceptors, creates a material called an **extrinsic semiconductor**. An extrinsic semiconductor will have either a preponderance of electrons (n type) or a preponderance of holes (p type).

### 4.2.2 Ionization Energy

We can calculate the approximate distance of the donor electron from the donor impurity ion, and also the approximate energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band. This energy is referred to as the **ionization energy**. We will use the Bohr model of the atom for these calculations. The justification for using this model is that the most probable distance of an electron from the nucleus in a hydrogen atom, determined from quantum mechanics, is the same as the Bohr radius. The energy levels in the hydrogen atom determined from quantum mechanics are also the same as obtained from the Bohr theory.

In the case of the donor impurity atom, we may visualize the donor electron orbiting the donor ion, which is embedded in the semiconductor material. We will need to use the permittivity of the semiconductor material in the calculations rather than the permittivity of free space as is used in the case of the hydrogen atom. We will also use the effective mass of the electron in the calculations.
