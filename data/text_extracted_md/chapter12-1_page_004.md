**Figure 12.4** (a) Biasing of an npn bipolar transistor in the forward-active mode, (b) minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode, and (c) energy-band diagram of the npn bipolar transistor under zero bias and under a forward-active mode bias.

Figure 12.4a. This configuration is called the **forward-active** operating mode: The B–E junction is forward biased so electrons from the emitter are injected across the B–E junction into the base. These injected electrons create an excess concentration of minority carriers in the base. The B–C junction is reverse biased, so the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the B–C junction is ideally zero. We expect the electron concentration in the base to be like that shown in
