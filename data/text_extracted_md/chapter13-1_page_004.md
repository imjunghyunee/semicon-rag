**Figure 13.3.1** Gate-to-channel space charge regions and \( I-V \) characteristics for small \( V_{DS} \) values and for (a) zero gate voltage, (b) small reverse-biased gate voltage, and (c) a gate voltage to achieve pinchoff.

If the drain voltage increases further, the condition shown in Figure 13.4c can result. The channel has been pinched off at the drain terminal. Any further increase in drain voltage will not cause an increase in drain current. The \( I-V \) characteristic for this condition is also shown in this figure. The drain voltage at pinchoff is referred to as \( V_{DS}(sat) \). For \( V_{DS} > V_{DS}(sat) \), the transistor is said to be in the saturation region and the drain current, for this ideal case, is independent of \( V_{DS} \). At first glance, we might expect the drain current to go to zero when the channel becomes pinched off at the drain terminal, but we will show why this does not happen.
