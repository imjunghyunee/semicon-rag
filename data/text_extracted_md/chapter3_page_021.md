# 3.2.4 Concept of the Hole

In considering the two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding shown in Figure 3.13a, a positively charged “empty state” was created when a valence electron was elevated into the conduction band. For \( T > 0 \, \text{K} \), all valence electrons may gain thermal energy; if a valence electron gains a small amount of thermal energy, it may hop into the empty state. **The movement of a valence electron into the empty state is equivalent to the movement of the positively charged empty state itself.** Figure 3.17 shows the movement of valence electrons in the crystal, alternately filling one empty state and creating a new empty state—a motion equivalent to a positive charge moving in the valence band. The crystal now has a second equally important charge carrier that can give rise to a current. This charge carrier is called a **hole** and, as we will see, can also be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled using Newtonian mechanics.

The drift current density due to electrons in the valence band, such as shown in Figure 3.14b, can be written as

\[
J = -e \sum_{i \, ( \text{filled} )} v_i
\]

(3.49)

where the summation extends over all filled states. This summation is inconvenient since it extends over a nearly full valence band and takes into account a very large number of states. We may rewrite Equation (3.49) in the form

\[
J = -e \sum_{i \, ( \text{debit} )} v_i + e \sum_{i \, ( \text{empty} )} v_i
\]

(3.50)

If we consider a band that is totally full, all available states are occupied by electrons. The individual electrons can be thought of as moving with a velocity as given by Equation (3.39):

\[
v(E) = \left( \frac{1}{\hbar} \right) \frac{dE}{dk}
\]

(3.39)

**The band is symmetric in \( k \) and each state is occupied so that, for every electron with a velocity \( |v| \), there is a corresponding electron with a velocity \( -|v| \).** Since the band is full, the distribution of electrons with respect to \( k \) cannot be changed with an
