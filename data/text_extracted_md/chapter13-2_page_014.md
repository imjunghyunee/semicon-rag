# CHAPTER 13 The Junction Field-Effect Transistor

separation between the carriers and ionized donors increases further the electron mobility, since there is even less coulomb interaction. One disadvantage of this graded heterojunction is that the electron density in the potential well tends to be smaller than in the abrupt junction.

The molecular beam epitaxial process allows the growth of very thin layers of specific semiconductor materials with specific dopings. In particular, a multilayer modulation–doped heterostructure can be formed, as shown in Figure 13.25. Several surface channel layers of electrons are formed in parallel. This structure would be equivalent to increasing the channel electron density, which would increase the current capability of the FET.

## 13.5.2 Transistor Performance

A typical HEMT structure is shown in Figure 13.26. The N-AlGaAs is separated from the undoped GaAs by an undoped AlGaAs spacer. A Schottky contact to the N-AlGaAs forms the gate of the transistor. This structure is a “normal” MODFET. An “inverted” structure is shown in Figure 13.27. In this case the Schottky contact is made to the undoped GaAs layer. The inverted MODFET has been investigated less than the normal structure because the normal structure has yielded superior results.

The density of electrons in the two-dimensional electron gas layer in the potential well can be controlled by the gate voltage. The electric field of the Schottky gate depletes the two-dimensional electron gas layer in the potential well when a
