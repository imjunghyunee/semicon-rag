that are injected into the forward-biased B–E space charge region will recombine in this region. This recombination leads to the electron flux \( J_{E} \). Generation of electrons and holes occurs in the reverse-biased B–C junction. This generation yields a hole flux \( J_{G} \). Finally, the ideal reverse-saturation current in the B–C junction is denoted by the hole flux \( J_{C0} \).

The corresponding electric current density components in the npn transistor are shown in Figure 12.19 along with the minority carrier distributions for the forward-active mode. The curves are the same as in Figure 12.14. As in the pn junction, the currents in the bipolar transistor are defined in terms of minority carrier diffusion currents. The current densities are defined as follows:

- \( J_{nE} \): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier electrons in the base at \( x = 0 \).
- \( J_{nC} \): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier electrons in the base at \( x = x_B \).
- \( J_{nB} \): The difference between \( J_{nE} \) and \( J_{nC} \), which is due to the recombination of excess minority carrier electrons with majority carrier holes in the base. The \( J_{nB} \) current is the flow of holes into the base to replace the holes lost by recombination.
- \( J_{pE} \): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier holes in the emitter at \( x' = 0 \).
- \( J_{rE} \): Due to the recombination of carriers in the forward-biased B–E junction.
- \( J_{pC0} \): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier holes in the collector at \( x'' = 0 \).
- \( J_{G} \): Due to the generation of carriers in the reverse-biased B–C junction.
