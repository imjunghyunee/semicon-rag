## The Bipolar Transistor

The transistor is a multijunction semiconductor device that, in conjunction with other circuit elements, is capable of current gain, voltage gain, and signal power gain. The transistor is therefore referred to as an active device, whereas the diode is passive. The basic transistor action is the control of current at one terminal by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the device.

The **Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)** is one of two major types of transistors. The fundamental physics of the BJT is developed in this chapter. The bipolar transistor is used extensively in analog electronic circuits because of its high current gain.

Two complementary configurations of BJTs, the npn and pnp devices, can be fabricated. Electronic circuit design becomes very versatile when the two types of devices are used in the same circuit.

In this chapter, we will:

- Discuss the physical structure of the bipolar transistor, which has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions that are sufficiently close together so interactions occur between the two junctions.
- Discuss the basic principle of operation of the bipolar transistor, including the various possible modes of operation.
- Derive expressions for the minority carrier concentrations through the device for various operating modes.
- Derive expressions for the various current components in the bipolar transistor.
- Define common-base and common-emitter current gains.
- Define the limiting factors and derive expressions for the current gain.
- Discuss several nonideal effects in bipolar transistors, including base width modulation and high-level injection effects.
