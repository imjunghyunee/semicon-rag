**Figure 8.30** (a) Simplified energy-band diagram of a tunnel diode with a reverse-biased voltage; (b) I–V characteristic of a tunnel diode with a reverse-biased voltage.

The portion of the curve showing a decrease in current with an increase in voltage is the region of differential negative resistance. The range of voltage and current for this region is quite small; thus, any power generated from an oscillator using this negative resistance property would also be fairly small.

A simplified energy-band diagram of the tunnel diode with an applied reverse-biased voltage is shown in Figure 8.30a. Electrons in the valence band on the p side are directly opposite empty states in the conduction band on the n side, so electrons can now tunnel directly from the p region into the n region, resulting in a large reverse-biased tunneling current. This tunneling current will exist for any reverse-biased voltage. The reverse-biased current will increase monotonically and rapidly with reverse-biased voltage as shown in Figure 8.30b.

## 8.6.1 Summary

- When a forward-bias voltage is applied across a pn junction (p region positive with respect to the n region), the potential barrier is lowered so that holes from the p region and electrons from the n region can flow across the junction.
- The boundary conditions relating the minority carrier hole concentration in the n region at the space charge edge and the minority carrier electron concentration in the p region at the space charge edge were derived.
- The holes that are injected into the n region and the electrons that are injected into the p region now become excess minority carriers. The behavior of the excess minority carrier is described by the ambipolar transport equation developed and described in Chapter 6. Solving the ambipolar transport equation and using the boundary conditions, the steady-state minority carrier hole and electron concentrations in the n region and p region, respectively, were derived.
- Gradients exist in the minority carrier hole and electron concentrations so that minority carrier diffusion currents exist in the pn junction. These diffusion currents yield the ideal current–voltage relationship of the pn junction diode.
