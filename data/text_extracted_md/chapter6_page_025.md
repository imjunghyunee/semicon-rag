# CHAPTER 6 Non-equilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

**Comment**

Equation (6.77) then predicts that in approximately four time constants, or in approximately 2 ps, the net charge density is essentially zero; that is, quasi-neutrality has been achieved. Since the continuity equation, Equation (6.73), does not contain any generation or recombination terms, the initial positive charge is then neutralized by pulling in electrons from the bulk n-type material to create excess electrons. This process occurs very quickly compared to the normal excess carrier lifetimes of approximately 0.1 μs. The condition of quasi-charge-neutrality is then justified.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**

Ex 6.6 (a) Consider n-type GaAs doped to \( N_d = 5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Determine the dielectric relaxation time. (b) Repeat part (a) for p-type silicon doped to \( N_a = 2 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

## *6.3.5 Haynes–Shockley Experiment

We have derived the mathematics describing the behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor. The Haynes–Shockley experiment was one of the first experiments to actually measure excess carrier behavior.

Figure 6.11 shows the basic experimental arrangement. The voltage source \( V_1 \) establishes an applied electric field \( E_0 \) in the \( +x \) direction in the n-type semiconductor sample. Excess carriers are effectively injected into the semiconductor at contact A. Contact B is a rectifying contact that is under reverse bias by the voltage source \( V_2 \). The contact B will collect a fraction of the excess carriers as they drift through the semiconductor. The collected carriers will generate an output voltage, \( V_0 \).

This experiment corresponds to the problem we discussed in Example 6.5. Figure 6.12 shows the excess carrier concentrations at contacts A and B for two conditions. Figure 6.12a shows the idealized excess carrier pulse at contact A at time \( t = 0 \). For a given electric field \( E_0 \), the excess carriers will drift along the
