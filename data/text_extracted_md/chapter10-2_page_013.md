Any “smearing out” in the experimental curve indicates the presence of interface states and any parallel shift indicates the presence of fixed oxide charge. The amount of smearing out can be used to determine the density of interface states. These types of measurement are extremely useful in the study of radiation effects on MOS devices.

## 10.3.1 The Basic MOSFET Operation

The current in a MOSFET is due to the flow of charge in the inversion layer or channel region adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. We have discussed the creation of the inversion layer charge in enhancement-type MOS capacitors. We may also have depletion-type devices in which a channel already exists at zero gate voltage.

### 10.3.1 MOSFET Structures

There are four basic MOSFET device types. Figure 10.34 shows an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET. Implicit in the enhancement mode notation is the idea that the semiconductor substrate is not inverted directly under the oxide with zero gate voltage. A positive gate voltage induces the electron inversion layer, which then “connects” the n-type source and the n-type drain regions. The source terminal is the source of carriers that flow through the channel to the drain terminal. For this n-channel device, electrons flow from the source to the drain so the conventional current will enter the drain and leave the source. The conventional circuit symbol for this n-channel enhancement mode device is also shown in the figure.

Figure 10.35 shows an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET. An n-channel region exists under the oxide with 0 V applied to the gate. However, we have shown that the threshold voltage of a MOS device with a p-type substrate may be negative; this means that an electron inversion layer already exists with zero gate voltage applied. Such a device is also considered to be a depletion mode device. The n-channel shown in the figure can be an electron inversion layer or an intentionally doped n region. The conventional circuit symbol for the n-channel depletion mode MOSFET is also shown in the figure.

Figures 10.36a, b show a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and a p-channel depletion mode MOSFET. In the p-channel enhancement mode device, a negative gate voltage...
