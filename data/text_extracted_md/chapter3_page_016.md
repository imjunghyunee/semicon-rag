The semiconductor is neutrally charged. This means that, as the negatively charged electron breaks away from its covalent bonding position, a positively charged "empty state" is created in the original covalent bonding position in the valence band. As the temperature further increases, more covalent bonds are broken, more electrons jump to the conduction band, and more positive "empty states" are created in the valence band.

We can also relate this bond breaking to the \( E \) versus \( k \) energy bands. **Figure 3.14a** shows the \( E \) versus \( k \) diagram of the conduction and valence bands at \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \). The energy states in the valence band are completely full and the states in the conduction band are empty. **Figure 3.14b** shows these same bands for \( T > 0 \, \text{K} \), in which some electrons have gained enough energy to jump to the conduction band and have left empty states in the valence band. We are assuming at this point that no external forces are applied so the electron and "empty state" distributions are symmetrical with \( k \).
