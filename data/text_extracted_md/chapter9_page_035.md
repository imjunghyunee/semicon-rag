**9.1** Consider a contact between Al and n Si doped at \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \).  
(a) Draw the energy-band diagrams of the two materials before the junction is formed.  
(b) Draw the ideal energy band at zero bias after the junction is formed.  
(c) Calculate \( \Phi_{B0} \), \( V_{bi} \), and \( E_{\text{max}} \) for part (b).  
(d) Repeat parts (b) and (c) using the data in Figure 9.5.

**9.2** (a) A Schottky barrier diode formed on n-type silicon has a doping concentration of \( N_d = 5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and a barrier height of \( \Phi_{B0} = 0.65 \, \text{V} \). Determine the built-in potential barrier \( V_{bi} \).  
(b) If the doping concentration changes to \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), determine the values of \( \Phi_{B0} \) and \( V_{bi} \). Do these values increase, decrease, or remain the same?  
(c) Repeat part (b) if the doping concentration is \( N_d = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

Determine the theoretical values of (a) \( \Phi_{B0} \), (b) \( V_{bi} \), and (c) \( E_{\text{max}} \) at (i) \( V_R = 1 \, \text{V} \) and (ii) \( V_R = 5 \, \text{V} \).

**9.4** A Schottky diode is formed by depositing gold on n-type GaAs that is doped at a concentration of \( N_d = 5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). For \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), determine the theoretical values of (a) \( \Phi_{B0} \), (b) \( \Phi_{B0} \), (c) \( V_{bi} \), and (d) \( E_{\text{max}} \) at (i) \( V_R = 1 \, \text{V} \) and (ii) \( V_R = 5 \, \text{V} \).
