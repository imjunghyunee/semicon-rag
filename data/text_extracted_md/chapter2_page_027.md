# 2.5.1 Summary

- A few basic concepts of quantum mechanics, which can be used to describe the behavior of electrons under various potential functions, were considered. The understanding of electron behavior is crucial in understanding semiconductor physics.
- The wave–particle duality principle is an important element in quantum mechanics. Particles can have wave-like behavior and waves can have particle-like behavior.
- Schrödinger’s wave equation forms the basis for describing and predicting the behavior of electrons.
- Max Born postulated that \(|\psi(x)|^2\) is a probability density function.
- A result of applying Schrödinger’s wave equation to a bound particle is that the energy of the bound particle is quantized.
- A result of applying Schrödinger’s wave equation to an electron incident on a potential barrier is that there is a finite probability of tunneling.
- The concept of quantum numbers was developed from the results of applying Schrödinger’s wave equation to the one-electron atom.
- The basic structure of the periodic table is predicted by applying Schrödinger’s wave equation to the one-electron atom and using the Pauli exclusion principle.
