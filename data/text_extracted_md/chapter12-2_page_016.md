The excess minority carrier concentration in the base, and hence the collector current, will increase at a slower rate with B–E voltage in high injection than low injection. This effect is shown in Figure 12.25. The high-injection effect is very similar to the effect of a series resistance in a pn junction diode.

## 12.4.3 Emitter Bandgap Narrowing

Another phenomenon affecting the emitter injection efficiency is bandgap narrowing. We have implied from our previous discussion that the emitter injection efficiency factor will continue to increase and approach unity as the ratio of emitter doping to base doping continues to increase. As silicon becomes heavily doped, the discrete donor energy level in an n-type emitter splits into a band of energies. The distance between donor atoms decreases as the concentration of impurity donor atoms increases, and the splitting of the donor level is caused by the interaction of donor atoms with each other. As the doping continues to increase, the donor band widens, becomes skewed, and moves up toward the conduction band, eventually merging with it. At this point, the effective bandgap energy has decreased. Figure 12.26 shows a plot of the change in the bandgap energy with impurity doping concentration.

A reduction in the bandgap energy increases the intrinsic carrier concentration. The intrinsic carrier concentration is given by

\[
n_i^2 = N_c N_v \exp\left(\frac{-E_g}{kT}\right)
\]

In a heavily doped emitter, the intrinsic carrier concentration can be written as

\[
n_{ie}^2 = N_c N_v \exp\left(\frac{-E_{g0} - \Delta E_g}{kT}\right) = n_i^2 \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E_g}{kT}\right)
\]
