# CHAPTER 3: Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

## Solution

The volume density of quantum states, from Equation (3.69), is given by:

\[
N = \int_{0}^{E} g(E) \, dE = \frac{4\pi(2m)^{3/2}}{h^3} \cdot \int_{0}^{E} \sqrt{E} \, dE
\]

or

\[
N = \frac{4\pi(2m)^{3/2}}{h^3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot E^{3/2}
\]

The density of states is now:

\[
N = \frac{4\pi(29.11 \times 10^{-31})^{3/2}}{(6.625 \times 10^{-34})^3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^{3/2} = 4.5 \times 10^{21} \, \text{m}^{-3}
\]

or

\[
N = 4.5 \times 10^{21} \, \text{states/cm}^3
\]

## Comment

The density of quantum states is typically a large number. An effective density of states in a semiconductor, as we will see in the following sections and in the next chapter, is also a large number but is usually less than the density of atoms in the semiconductor crystal.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 3.3** For a free electron, calculate the density of quantum states (#/cmÂ³) over the energy range of (a) \(0 \leq E \leq 2.0 \, \text{eV}\) and (b) \(1 \leq E \leq 2 \, \text{eV}\).

## 3.4.2 Extension to Semiconductors

In the previous section, we derived a general expression for the density of allowed electron quantum states using the model of a free electron with mass \(m\) bounded in a three-dimensional infinite potential well. We can extend this same general model to a semiconductor to determine the density of quantum states in the conduction band and the density of quantum states in the valence band. Electrons and holes are confined within the semiconductor crystal, so we will again use the basic model of the infinite potential well.

The parabolic relationship between energy and momentum of a free electron is given in Equation (3.28) as \(E = p^2/2m = \hbar^2k^2/2m\). Figure 3.16a shows the conduction energy band in the reduced \(k\) space. The \(E\) versus \(k\) curve near \(k = 0\) at the bottom of the conduction band can be approximated as a parabola, so we may write:

\[
E = E_c + \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m^*}
\]

where \(E_c\) is the bottom edge of the conduction band and \(m^*\) is the electron density of states effective mass. Equation (3.70) may be rewritten to give:

\[
E = E_c + \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m^*}
\]
