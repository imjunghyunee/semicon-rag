The C–V characteristics can be used to determine the equivalent fixed oxide charge. For a given MOS structure, \(\phi_{ms}\) and \(C_{ox}\) are known, so the ideal flat-band voltage and flat-band capacitance can be calculated. The experimental value of flat-band voltage can be measured from the C–V curve, and the value of fixed oxide charge can then be determined. The C–V measurements are a valuable diagnostic tool to characterize a MOS device. This characterization is especially useful in the study of radiation effects on MOS devices, for example.

We first encountered oxide–semiconductor interface states in Chapter 9 in the discussion of Schottky barrier diodes. Figure 10.31 shows the energy-band diagram of a semiconductor at the oxide–semiconductor interface. The periodic nature of the semiconductor is abruptly terminated at the interface so that allowed electronic energy levels will exist within the forbidden bandgap. These allowed energy states are referred to as interface states. Charge can flow between the semiconductor and interface states, in contrast to the fixed oxide charge. The net charge in these interface states is a function of the position of the Fermi level in the bandgap.

In general, acceptor states exist in the upper half of the bandgap and donor states exist in the lower half of the bandgap. An acceptor state is neutral if the Fermi level is below the state and becomes negatively charged if the Fermi level is above the state. A donor state is neutral if the Fermi level is above the state and becomes positively charged if the Fermi level is below the state. The charge of the interface states is then a function of the gate voltage applied across the MOS capacitor.

Figure 10.32a shows the energy-band diagram in a p-type semiconductor of a MOS capacitor biased in the accumulation condition. In this case, there is a net positive charge trapped in the donor states. Now let the gate voltage change to produce the energy-band diagram shown in Figure 10.32b. The Fermi level corresponds to...
