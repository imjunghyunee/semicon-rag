The capacitance \( C' \) per unit area of the MOS capacitor for this accumulation mode is just the oxide capacitance, or

\[
C'(acc) = C_{ox} = \frac{\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}
\]

Figure 10.24a shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS device when a small positive voltage is applied to the gate, inducing a space charge region in the semiconductor; Figure 10.24b shows the charge distribution through the device for this condition. The oxide capacitance and the capacitance of the depletion region are in series. A small differential change in voltage across the capacitor will cause a differential change in the space charge width. The corresponding differential changes
