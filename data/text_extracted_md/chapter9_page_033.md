## 9.3.5 Current–Voltage Characteristics

The ideal current–voltage characteristics of a pn homojunction have been developed in Chapter 8. Since the energy-band diagram of a heterojunction is more complicated than that of a homojunction, we would expect the I–V characteristics of the two junctions to differ.

One immediate difference between a homojunction and a heterojunction is in the barrier heights seen by the electrons and holes. Since the built-in potential barrier for electrons and holes in a homojunction is the same, the relative magnitude of the electron and hole currents is determined by the relative doping levels. In a heterojunction, the barrier heights seen by electrons and holes are not the same. The energy-band diagrams in Figures 9.18 and 9.23 demonstrate that the barrier heights for electrons and holes in a heterojunction can be significantly different. The barrier height for electrons in Figure 9.18 is larger than that for holes, so we would expect the current due to electrons to be insignificant compared to the hole current. If the barrier height for electrons is 0.2 eV larger than that for holes, the electron current will be approximately a factor of 10⁴ smaller than the hole current, assuming all other parameters are equal. The opposite situation exists for the band diagram shown in Figure 9.23.

The conduction-band edge in Figure 9.23 and the valence-band edge in Figure 9.18 are somewhat similar to that of a rectifying metal–semiconductor contact. We derive the current–voltage characteristics of a heterojunction, in general, on the basis of thermionic emission of carriers over the barrier, as we do in the case of metal–semiconductor junction. We can then write

\[
J = A^* T^2 \exp \left( -\frac{E_v}{kT} \right)
\]

(9.51)

where \( E_v \) is an effective barrier height. The barrier height can be increased or reduced by an applied potential across the junction as in the case of a pn homojunction or a Schottky barrier junction. The heterojunction I–V characteristics, however, may need to be modified to include diffusion effects and tunneling effects. Another complicating factor is that the effective mass of a carrier changes from one side of the junction to the other. Although the actual derivation of the I–V relationship of the heterojunction is complex, the general form of the I–V equation is still similar to that of a Schottky barrier diode and is generally dominated by one type of carrier.

## 9.4 | SUMMARY

- A metal on a lightly doped semiconductor can produce a rectifying contact that is known as a Schottky barrier diode. The ideal barrier height between the metal and semiconductor is the difference between the metal work function and the semiconductor electron affinity.
- When a positive voltage is applied to an n-type semiconductor with respect to the metal (reverse bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal increases so that there is essentially no flow of charged carriers. When a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to an n-type semiconductor (forward bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal is lowered so that electrons can easily flow from the semiconductor into the metal by a process called thermionic emission.
