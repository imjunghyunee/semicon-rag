# 13.1 JFET CONCEPTS

The concept of the field-effect phenomenon was the basis for the first proposed solid-state transistor. Patents filed in the 1920s and 1930s conceived and investigated the transistor shown in Figure 13.1. A voltage applied to the metal plate modulated the conductance of the semiconductor under the metal and controlled the current between the ohmic contacts. Good semiconductor materials and processing technology were not available at that time, so the device was not seriously considered again until the 1950s.

The phenomenon of modulating the conductance of a semiconductor by an electric field applied perpendicular to the surface of a semiconductor is called field effect. This type of transistor has also been called the unipolar transistor, to emphasize that only one type of carrier, the majority carrier, is involved in the operation. We will qualitatively discuss the basic operation of the two types of JFETs in this section, and introduce some of the JFET terminology.

## 13.1.1 Basic pn JFET Operation

The first type of field-effect transistor is the pn junction field-effect transistor, or pn JFET. A simplified cross section of a symmetrical device is shown in Figure 13.2. The n region between the two p regions is known as the channel and, in this n-channel
