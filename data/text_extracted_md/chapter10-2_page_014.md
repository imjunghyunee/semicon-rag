Gate voltage must be applied to create an inversion layer of holes that will “connect” the p-type source and drain regions. Holes flow from the source to the drain, so the conventional current will enter the source and leave the drain. A p-channel region exists in the depletion mode device even with zero gate voltage. The conventional circuit symbols are shown in the figure.

## 10.3.2 Current–Voltage Relationship—Concepts

Figure 10.37a shows an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET with a gate-to-source voltage that is less than the threshold voltage and with only a very small drain-to-source voltage. The source and substrate, or body, terminals are held at ground potential. With this bias configuration, there is no electron inversion layer, the drain-to-substrate pn junction is reverse biased, and the drain current is zero (disregarding pn junction leakage currents).
