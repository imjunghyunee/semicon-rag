and dimensions are not the same as we have encountered in small switching transistors. The primary collector region has a low-doped impurity concentration so that a large base–collector voltage can be applied without initiating breakdown. Another n region, with a higher doping concentration, reduces collector resistance and makes contact with the external collector terminal. The base region is also much wider than normally encountered in small devices. A large base–collector voltage implies a relatively large space charge width being induced in both the collector and base regions. A relatively large base width is required to prevent punch-through breakdown.

Power transistors must also be large-area devices in order to handle large currents. We have previously considered the interdigitated structure that is repeated in Figure 15.11. Relatively small emitter widths are required to prevent the emitter current crowding effects that were discussed in Section 12.4.4.

### 15.4.2 Power Transistor Characteristics

The relatively wide base width implies a much smaller current gain \( \beta \) for power transistors compared to small switching transistors, and large area device implies a larger junction capacitance and hence lower cutoff frequency for a power transistor compared to a small switching transistor. Table 15.1 compares the parameters of a
