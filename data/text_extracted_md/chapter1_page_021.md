# Miller Indices

- **Miller indices**: The set of integers used to describe a crystal plane.
- **Primitive cell**: The smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form a lattice.
- **Substrate**: A semiconductor wafer or other material used as the starting material for further semiconductor processing, such as epitaxial growth or diffusion.
- **Ternary semiconductor**: A three-element compound semiconductor, such as aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs).
- **Unit cell**: A small volume of a crystal that can be used to reproduce the entire crystal.
- **Zincblende lattice**: A lattice structure identical to the diamond lattice except that there are two types of atoms instead of one.
