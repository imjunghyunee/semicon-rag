# Chapter 14: Optical Devices

Inversely proportional to lifetime, we can write the quantum efficiency in terms of lifetimes as

\[
\eta_q = \frac{\tau_{nr}}{\tau_{nr} + \tau_r}
\]

(14.50)

where \(\tau_{nr}\) is the nonradiative lifetime and \(\tau_r\) is the radiative lifetime. For a high luminescent efficiency, the nonradiative lifetimes must be large; thus, the probability of a nonradiative recombination is small compared to the radiative recombination.

The interband recombination rate of electrons and holes will be directly proportional to the number of electrons available and directly proportional to the number of available empty states (holes). We can write

\[
R = Bnp
\]

(14.51)

where \(R\) is the band-to-band radiative recombination rate and \(B\) is the constant of proportionality. The values of \(B\) for direct-bandgap materials are on the order of \(10^6\) larger than for indirect bandgap materials. The probability of a direct band-to-band radiative recombination transition in an indirect bandgap material is very unlikely.

One problem encountered with the emission of photons from a direct bandgap material is the reabsorption of the emitted photons. In general, the emitted photons will have energies \(h\nu > E_p\), which means that the absorption coefficient is not zero for this energy. In order to generate a light output from a light emitting device, the process must take place near the surface. One possible solution to the reabsorption problem is to use heterojunction devices. These are discussed in later sections.

## 14.4.3 Materials

An important direct bandgap semiconductor material for optical devices is gallium arsenide. Another compound material that is of great interest is Al\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)As. This material is a compound semiconductor in which the ratio of aluminum atoms to gallium atoms can be varied to achieve specific characteristics. Figure 14.23 shows the bandgap energy as a function of the mole fraction between aluminum and gallium. We can note from the figure that for \(0 < x < 0.45\), the alloy material is a direct bandgap material. For \(x > 0.45\), the material becomes an indirect bandgap material, not suitable for optical devices. For \(0 < x < 0.35\), the bandgap energy can be expressed as

\[
E_g = 1.424 + 1.247x \, \text{eV}
\]

(14.52)

Another compound semiconductor used for optical devices is the GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) system. Figure 14.24a shows the bandgap energy as a function of the mole fraction \(x\). For \(0 \leq x \leq 0.45\), this material is also a direct bandgap material, and for \(x > 0.45\), the bandgap becomes indirect. Figure 14.24b is the \(E\) versus \(k\) diagram, showing how the bandgap changes from direct to indirect as the mole fraction changes.
