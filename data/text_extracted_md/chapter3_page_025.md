## Energy Bands in Metals

### Figure 3.21

Two possible energy bands of a metal showing:

- **(a)** a partially filled band
- **(b)** overlapping allowed energy bands.

This energy-band diagram represents a semiconductor for \( T > 0 \, \text{K} \). The resistivity of a semiconductor, as we will see in the next chapter, can be controlled and varied over many orders of magnitude.

The characteristics of a metal include a very low resistivity. The energy-band diagram for a metal may be in one of two forms. Figure 3.21a shows the case of a partially full band in which there are many electrons available for conduction, so that the material can exhibit a large electrical conductivity. Figure 3.21b shows another possible energy-band diagram of a metal. The band splitting into allowed and forbidden energy bands is a complex phenomenon, and Figure 3.21b shows a case in which the conduction and valence bands overlap at the equilibrium interatomic distance. As in the case shown in Figure 3.21a, there are large numbers of electrons as well as large numbers of empty energy states into which the electrons can move, so this material can also exhibit a very high electrical conductivity.

## Test Your Understanding

### TYU 3.3

A simplified \( E \) versus \( k \) curve for an electron in the conduction band is given. The value of \( a \) is 10 Å. Determine the relative effective mass \( m^*/m_0 \).  
(\( 5L1T = \frac{\partial u}{\partial u} \, s^2V \))

### TYU 3.4

A simplified \( E \) versus \( k \) curve for a hole in the valence band is given. Assume a value of \( a = 12 \, \text{Å} \). Determine the relative effective mass \( m^*/m_0 \).  
(\( 586T0 = \frac{\partial u}{\partial u} \, s^2V \))
