**Figure 10.27** Ideal low-frequency capacitance versus gate voltage of a MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate.

The same type of ideal C–V characteristics is obtained for a MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate by changing the sign of the voltage axis. The accumulation condition is obtained for a positive gate bias and the inversion condition is obtained for a negative gate bias. This ideal curve is shown in Figure 10.27.

## 10.2.2 Frequency Effects

Figure 10.25a shows the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate and biased in the inversion condition. We have argued that a differential change in the capacitor voltage in the ideal case causes a differential change in the inversion layer charge density. However, we must consider the source of electrons that produces a change in the inversion charge density.

There are two sources of electrons that can change the charge density of the inversion layer. The first source is by diffusion of minority carrier electrons from the p-type substrate across the space charge region. This diffusion process is the same as that in a reverse-biased pn junction that generates the ideal reverse saturation current. The second source of electrons is by thermal generation of electron–hole pairs within the space charge region. This process is again the same as that in a reverse-biased pn junction generating the reverse-biased generation current. Both of these processes generate electrons at a particular rate. The electron concentration in the inversion layer, then, cannot change instantaneously. If the ac voltage across the MOS capacitor changes rapidly, the change in the inversion layer charge will not be able to respond. The C–V characteristics will then be a function of the frequency of the ac signal used to measure the capacitance.

In the limit of a very high frequency, the inversion layer charge will not respond to a differential change in capacitor voltage. Figure 10.28 shows the charge distribution in the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate. At a high-signal frequency, the differential change in charge occurs at the metal and in the space charge width in the semiconductor.

The capacitance of the MOS capacitor is then \( C_{\text{min}} \), which we discussed earlier. Both the high-frequency and low-frequency limits of the C–V characteristics are shown in Figure 10.29. In general, high frequency corresponds to a value on the order of 1 MHz and low frequency corresponds to values in the range of 5 to 100 Hz. Typically, the high-frequency characteristics of the MOS capacitor are measured.
