# 5.5.1 Summary

- The two basic transport mechanisms are drift, due to an applied electric field, and diffusion, due to a density gradient.
- Carriers reach an average drift velocity in the presence of an applied electric field, due to scattering events. Two scattering processes within a semiconductor are lattice scattering and impurity scattering.
- The average drift velocity is a linear function of the applied electric field for small values of electric field, but the drift velocity reaches a saturation limit that is on the order of \(10^7 \, \text{cm/s}\) at high electric fields.
- Carrier mobility is the ratio of the average drift velocity and applied electric field. The electron and hole mobilities are functions of temperature and of the ionized impurity concentration.
- The drift current density is the product of conductivity and electric field (a form of Ohmâ€™s law). Conductivity is a function of the carrier concentrations and mobilities. Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity.
- The diffusion current density is proportional to the carrier diffusion coefficient and the carrier density gradient.
- The diffusion coefficient and mobility are related through the Einstein relation.
- The Hall effect is a consequence of a charged carrier moving in the presence of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. The charged carrier is deflected, inducing a Hall voltage. The polarity of the Hall voltage is a function of the semiconductor conductivity type. The majority carrier concentration and mobility can be determined from the Hall voltage.
