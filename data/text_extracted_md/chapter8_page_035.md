# CHAPTER 8 The pn Junction Diode

The hole diffusion current density can be calculated at \( x = 0 \). This is given by

\[
J_p = -eD_p \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x=0}
\]

(8.86)

If we consider a homogeneous semiconductor, the derivative of the hole concentration will be just the derivative of the excess hole concentration. Then

\[
J_p = -eD_p \frac{\partial (\delta p)}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x=0} = -eD_p \frac{\partial [\delta p(x)]}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x=0} = -eD_p \frac{\partial p(x)}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x=0} e^{j\omega t}
\]

(8.87)

We can write this equation in the form

\[
J_p = J_{p_0} + j_p(t)
\]

(8.88)

where

\[
J_{p_0} = -eD_p \frac{\partial [\delta p(x)]}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x=0} = \frac{eD_p p_{n_0}}{L_p} \left[ \exp \left( \frac{eV_0}{kT} \right) - 1 \right]
\]

(8.89)

Equation (8.89) is the dc component of the hole diffusion current density and is exactly the same as in the ideal Iâ€“V relation derived previously.

The sinusoidal component of the diffusion current density is then found from

\[
j_p(t) = \hat{j}_p e^{j\omega t} = -eD_p \frac{\partial p(x)}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x=0} e^{j\omega t}
\]

(8.90)

where \(\hat{j}_p\) is the current density phasor. Combining Equations (8.90), (8.84), and (8.85), we have

\[
\hat{J}_p = -eD_p (A - C_p) \left[ \frac{\hat{V}_i}{V_T} \right] e^{-j\omega t} \bigg|_{x=0}
\]

(8.91)

We can write the total ac hole current phasor as

\[
\hat{I}_p = A \hat{j}_p = eAD_p C_p \frac{\hat{v}_i}{V_T}
\]

(8.92)

where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the pn junction. Substituting the expression for \( C_p \), we obtain

\[
\hat{I}_p = \frac{eAD_p p_{n_0}}{L_p} \sqrt{1 + j\omega \tau_0} \left( \frac{\hat{v}_i}{V_T} \right)
\]

(8.93)

If we define

\[
I_{p_0} = \frac{eAD_p p_{L}}{L_p} = \frac{eAD_p p_{n_0}}{L_p} \exp \left( \frac{eV_0}{kT} \right)
\]

(8.94)

then Equation (8.93) becomes

\[
\hat{I}_p = I_{p_0} \sqrt{1 + j\omega \tau_0} \left( \frac{\hat{v}_i}{V_T} \right)
\]

(8.95)

Going through the same type of analysis for the minority carrier electrons in the p region, we obtain

\[
\hat{I}_n = I_{n_0} \sqrt{1 + j\omega \tau_0} \left( \frac{\hat{v}_i}{V_T} \right)
\]
