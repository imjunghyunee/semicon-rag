!Energy-band diagrams and I-V characteristics

**Figure 8.29** | (concluded) (d) A higher forward bias showing less tunneling current; (e) a forward bias for which the diffusion current dominates.

Figure 8.29a shows the energy-band diagram at zero bias, which produces zero current on the I–V diagram. If we assume, for simplicity, that we are near 0 K, then all energy states are filled below \( E_F \) on both sides of the junction.

Figure 8.29b shows the situation when a small forward-bias voltage is applied to the junction. Electrons in the conduction band of the n region are directly opposite to empty states in the valence band of the p region. There is a finite probability that some of these electrons will tunnel directly into the empty states, producing a forward-bias tunneling current as shown. With a slightly larger forward-bias voltage, as in Figure 8.29c, the maximum number of electrons in the n region will be opposite the maximum number of empty states in the p region; this will produce a maximum tunneling current.

As the forward-bias voltage continues to increase, the number of electrons on the n side directly opposite empty states on the p side decreases, as in Figure 8.29d, and the tunneling current will decrease. In Figure 8.29e, there are no electrons on the n side directly opposite to available empty states on the p side. For this forward-bias voltage, the tunneling current will be zero and the normal ideal diffusion current will exist in the device as shown in the I–V characteristics.
