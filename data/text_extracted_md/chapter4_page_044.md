## REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. How does the electron concentration in the conduction band change with energy \( E \) for \( E > E_c \)?

2. In deriving the equation for \( n_0 \) in terms of the Fermi function, the upper limit of the integral should be the energy at the top of the conduction band. Justify using infinity instead.

3. Assuming the Boltzmann approximation applies, write the equations for \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) in terms of the Fermi energy.

4. What is the source of electrons and holes in an intrinsic semiconductor?

5. Under what condition would the intrinsic Fermi level be at the midgap energy?

6. What is a donor impurity? What is an acceptor impurity?

7. What is meant by complete ionization? What is meant by freeze-out?

8. What is the product of \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) equal to?

9. Write the equation for charge neutrality for the condition of complete ionization.

10. Sketch a graph of \( n_0 \) versus temperature for an n-type material.

11. Sketch graphs of the Fermi energy versus donor impurity concentration and versus temperature.

12. What is the relevance of the Fermi energy?

## PROBLEMS

### Section 4.1 Charge Carriers in Semiconductors

**4.1** Calculate the intrinsic carrier concentration, \( n_i \), at \( T = 200, 400, \) and \( 600 \, K \) for  
(a) silicon, (b) germanium, and (c) gallium arsenide.

**4.2** Plot the intrinsic carrier concentration, \( n_i \), for a temperature range of 200 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 600 K for  
(a) silicon, (b) germanium, and (c) gallium arsenide. (Use a log scale for \( n_i \).)

**4.3**  
(a) The maximum intrinsic carrier concentration in a silicon device must be limited to \( 5 \times 10^{11} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Assume \( E_g = 1.12 \, \text{eV} \). Determine the maximum temperature allowed for the device.  
(b) Repeat part (a) if the maximum intrinsic carrier concentration is limited to \( 5 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

**4.4** In a particular semiconductor material, the effective density of states functions are given by \( N_c = N_{c0} (T/300)^{3/2} \) and \( N_v = N_{v0} (T/300)^{3/2} \) where \( N_{c0} \) and \( N_{v0} \) are constants independent of temperature. Experimentally determined intrinsic carrier concentrations are found to be \( n_i = 1.40 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) at \( T = 200 \, K \) and \( n_i = 7.70 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) at \( T = 400 \, K \). Determine the product \( N_{c0} \cdot N_{v0} \) and the bandgap energy \( E_g \). (Assume \( E_g \) is constant over this temperature range.)
