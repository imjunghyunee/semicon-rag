# 7.6 Summary

In a circuit application, we would, in general, like to have the resonant frequency be a linear function of reverse-biased voltage \( V_R \), so we need

\[
C \propto V^{-2}
\]

(7.78)

From Equation (7.77), the parameter \( m \) required is found from

\[
\frac{1}{m + 2} = 2
\]

(7.79a)

or

\[
m = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

(7.79b)

A specific doping profile will yield the desired capacitance characteristic.

## 7.6.1 Summary

- A uniformly doped pn junction is initially considered, in which one region of a semiconductor is uniformly doped with acceptor impurities and the adjacent region is uniformly doped with donor impurities.
- A space charge region, or depletion region, is formed on either side of the metallurgical junction separating the n and p regions. This region is essentially depleted of any mobile electrons or holes. A net positive charge density, due to the positively charged donor impurity ions, exists in the n region and a net negative charge density, due to the negatively charged acceptor impurity ions, exists in the p region.
- An electric field exists in the depletion region due to the net space charge density. The direction of the electric field is from the n region to the p region.
- A potential difference exists across the space charge region. Under zero applied bias, this potential difference, known as the built-in potential barrier, maintains thermal equilibrium and holds back majority carrier electrons in the n region and majority carrier holes in the p region.
- An applied reverse-biased voltage (n region positive with respect to the p region) increases the potential barrier, the space charge width, and the magnitude of the electric field.
- As the reverse-biased voltage changes, the amount of charge in the depletion region changes. This change in charge with voltage defines the junction capacitance.
- Avalanche breakdown occurs when a sufficiently large reverse-biased voltage is applied to the pn junction. A large reverse-biased current may then be induced in the pn junction. The breakdown voltage, as a function of the doping concentrations in the pn junction, is derived. In a one-sided pn junction, the breakdown voltage is a function of the doping concentration in the low-doped region.
- The linearly graded junction represents a nonuniformly doped pn junction. Expressions for the electric field, built-in potential barrier, and junction capacitance are derived. The functional relationships differ from those of the uniformly doped junction.
- Specific doping profiles can be used to obtain specific capacitance characteristics. A hyperabrupt junction is one in which the doping decreases away from the metallurgical junction. This type of junction is advantageous in varactor diodes that are used in resonant circuits.
