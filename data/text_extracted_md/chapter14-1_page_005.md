# CHAPTER 14 Optical Devices

In the second case, the absorption coefficient is \( \alpha \approx 10^4 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \) for \( \lambda = 0.5 \, \mu\text{m} \). The distance \( d \), then, in which 90 percent of the incident flux is absorbed, is

\[
d = \frac{1}{10^4} \ln \left( \frac{1}{0.1} \right) = 2.30 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm} = 2.30 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

**Comment**  
As the incident photon energy increases, the absorption coefficient increases rapidly, so that the photon energy can be totally absorbed in a very narrow region at the surface of the semiconductor.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**  
Ex 14.1 Consider a slab of silicon 5 \(\mu\text{m}\) thick. Determine the percentage of photon energy that will pass through the slab if the photon wavelength is (a) \(\lambda = 0.8 \, \mu\text{m}\) and (b) \(\lambda = 0.6 \, \mu\text{m}\).

The relation between the bandgap energies of some of the common semiconductor materials and the light spectrum is shown in Figure 14.5. We may note that silicon and gallium arsenide will absorb all of the visible spectrum, whereas gallium phosphide, for example, will be transparent to the red spectrum.

## 14.1.2 Electron–Hole Pair Generation Rate

We have shown that photons with energy greater than \( E_g \) can be absorbed in a semiconductor, thereby creating electron–hole pairs. The intensity \( I(x) \) is in units of
