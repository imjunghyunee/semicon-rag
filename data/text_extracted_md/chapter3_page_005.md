Electrons, since the first two energy shells are completely full and are tightly bound to the nucleus. The 3s state corresponds to \( n = 3 \) and \( l = 0 \) and contains two quantum states per atom. This state will contain two electrons at \( T = 0 \) K. The 3p state corresponds to \( n = 3 \) and \( l = 1 \) and contains six quantum states per atom. This state will contain the remaining two electrons in the individual silicon atom.

As the interatomic distance decreases, the 3s and 3p states interact and overlap. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, the bands have again split, but now four quantum states per atom are in the lower band and four quantum states per atom are in the upper band. At absolute zero degrees, electrons are in the lowest energy state, so that all states in the lower band (the valence band) will be full and all states in the
