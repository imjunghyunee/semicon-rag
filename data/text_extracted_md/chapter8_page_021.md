### 8.2.1 Generation–Recombination Currents

The recombination rate of excess electrons and holes, given by the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination theory, was written as

\[
R = \frac{C_n C_p N_t (np - n_i^2)}{C_n (n + n') + C_p (p + p')}
\]

(8.35)

The parameters \( n \) and \( p \) are, as usual, the concentrations of electrons and holes, respectively.

**Reverse-Biased Generation Current**  
For a pn junction under reverse bias, we have argued that the mobile electrons and holes have essentially been swept out of the space charge region. Accordingly, within the space charge region, \( n \approx p \approx 0 \). The recombination rate from Equation (8.35) becomes

\[
R = \frac{-C_n C_p N_t n_i^2}{C_n n' + C_p p'}
\]

(8.36)

The negative sign implies a negative recombination rate; hence, we are really generating electron–hole pairs within the reverse-biased space charge region. The recombination of excess electrons and holes is the process whereby we are trying to reestablish thermal equilibrium. Since the concentration of electrons and holes is essentially zero within the reverse-biased space charge region, electrons and holes are being generated via the trap level to also try to reestablish thermal equilibrium. This generation process is schematically shown in Figure 8.12. As the electrons and holes
