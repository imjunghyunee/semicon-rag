# 10.1 The Two-Terminal MOS Structure

Figure 10.4b shows the energy-band diagram for the case when a negative bias is applied to the gate. (Remember that positive electron energy is plotted “upward” and positive voltage is plotted “downward.”) The valence-band edge is closer to the Fermi level at the oxide–semiconductor interface than in the bulk material, which implies that there is an accumulation of holes. The semiconductor surface appears to be more p-type than the bulk material. The Fermi level is a constant in the semiconductor since the MOS system is in thermal equilibrium and there is no current through the oxide.

Figure 10.4c shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS system when a positive voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction- and valence-band edges bend as shown in the figure, indicating a space charge region similar to that in a pn junction. The conduction band and intrinsic Fermi levels move closer to the Fermi level. The induced space charge width is \( x_d \).

Now consider the case when a still larger positive voltage is applied to the top metal gate of the MOS capacitor. We expect the induced electric field to increase in magnitude and the corresponding positive and negative charges on the MOS capacitor to increase. A larger negative charge in the MOS capacitor implies a larger induced space charge region and more band bending. Figure 10.5 shows such a condition. The intrinsic Fermi level at the surface is now below the Fermi level. The conduction band at the surface is now close to the Fermi level, whereas the valence band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor. This result implies that the surface in the semiconductor adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is n type. By applying a sufficiently large positive gate voltage, we have inverted the surface of the semiconductor from a p-type to an n-type semiconductor. We have created an inversion layer of electrons at the oxide–semiconductor interface.

In the MOS capacitor structure that we have just considered, we assumed a p-type semiconductor substrate. The same type of energy-band diagrams can be constructed for a MOS capacitor with an n-type semiconductor substrate. Figure 10.6a shows the MOS capacitor structure with a positive voltage applied to the top gate terminal. A positive charge exists on the top gate and an electric field is induced with the direction shown in the figure. An accumulation layer of electrons will be induced in the n-type substrate. The case when a negative voltage is applied to the top gate.
