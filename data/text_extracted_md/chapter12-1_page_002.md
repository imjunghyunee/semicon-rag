## 12.1 | THE BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR ACTION

The bipolar transistor has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions. Figure 12.1 shows the basic structure of an npn bipolar transistor and a pnp bipolar transistor, along with the circuit symbols. The three terminal connections are called the emitter, base, and collector. The width of the base region is small compared to the minority carrier diffusion length. The (+++) and (++) notation indicates the relative magnitudes of the impurity doping concentrations normally used in the bipolar transistor, with (+++) meaning very heavily doped and (++) meaning moderately doped. The emitter region has the largest doping concentration; the collector region has the smallest. The reasons for using these relative impurity concentrations, and for the narrow base width, will become clear as we develop the theory of the bipolar transistor. The concepts developed for the pn junction apply directly to the bipolar transistor.

The block diagrams of Figure 12.1 show the basic structure of the transistor, but in very simplified sketches. Figure 12.2a shows a cross section of a classic npn bipolar transistor fabricated in an integrated circuit configuration, and Figure 12.2b shows the cross section of an npn bipolar transistor fabricated by a more modern technology. One can immediately observe that the actual structure of the bipolar transistor is not nearly as simple as the block diagrams of Figure 12.1 might suggest. A reason for the complexity is that terminal connections are made at the surface; in order to minimize semiconductor resistances, heavily doped n+ buried layers must be included. Another reason for complexity arises out of the desire to fabricate more than one bipolar transistor on a single piece of semiconductor material. Individual transistors must be isolated from each other since all collectors, for example, will not be at the same potential. This isolation is accomplished by adding p+ regions so that devices are separated by reverse-biased pn junctions as shown in Figure 12.2a, or they are isolated by large oxide regions as shown in Figure 12.2b.
