# 7.3 Reverse Applied Bias

## 7.3.1 Reverse Applied Bias

If we apply a potential between the p and n regions, we will no longer be in an equilibrium conditionâ€”the Fermi energy level will no longer be constant through the system. Figure 7.7 shows the energy-band diagram of the pn junction for the case when a positive voltage is applied to the n region with respect to the p region. As the positive potential is downward, the Fermi level on the n side is below the Fermi level on the p side. The difference between the two is equal to the applied voltage in units of energy.

The total potential barrier, indicated by \( V_{\text{total}} \), has increased. The applied potential is the reverse-biased condition. The total potential barrier is now given by

\[
V_{\text{total}} = |\phi_{p0}| + |\phi_{n0}| + V_R
\]

(7.32)

where \( V_R \) is the magnitude of the applied reverse-biased voltage. Equation (7.32) can be rewritten as

\[
V_{\text{total}} = V_{bi} + V_R
\]

(7.33)

where \( V_{bi} \) is the same built-in potential barrier we had defined in thermal equilibrium.

## 7.3.1 Space Charge Width and Electric Field

Figure 7.8 shows a pn junction with an applied reverse-biased voltage \( V_R \). Also indicated in the figure are the electric field in the space charge region and the electric field \( E_{\text{app}} \) induced by the applied voltage. The electric fields in the neutral p and n regions are essentially zero, or at least very small, which means that the magnitude of the electric field in the space charge region must increase above the thermal-equilibrium value due to the applied voltage. The electric field originates on positive charge and terminates on negative charge; this means that the number of positive and negative
