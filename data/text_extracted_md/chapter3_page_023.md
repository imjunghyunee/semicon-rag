# Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

Comparing Equation (3.55) with Equation (3.41), we may write

\[
\frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{d^2 E}{dk^2} = -\frac{2C_2}{\hbar^2} = \frac{1}{m^*}
\]

(3.56)

where \( m^* \) is again an effective mass. We have argued that \( C_2 \) is a positive quantity, which now implies that \( m^* \) is a negative quantity. **An electron moving near the top of an allowed energy band behaves as if it has a negative mass.**

We must keep in mind that the effective mass parameter is used to relate quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. The attempt to relate these two theories leads to this strange result of a negative effective mass. However, we must recall that solutions to Schrödinger’s wave equation also led to results that contradicted classical mechanics. The negative effective mass is another such example.

In discussing the concept of effective mass in the previous section, we used an analogy of marbles moving through two liquids. Now consider placing an ice cube in the center of a container filled with water: the ice cube will move upward toward the surface in a direction opposite to the gravitational force. The ice cube appears to have a negative effective mass since its acceleration is opposite to the external force. The effective mass parameter takes into account all internal forces acting on the particle.

If we again consider an electron near the top of an allowed energy band and use Newton’s force equation for an applied electric field, we will have

\[
F = m^* a = -eE
\]

(3.57)

However, \( m^* \) is now a negative quantity, so we may write

\[
a = -\frac{eE}{|m^*|} = +\frac{eE}{|m^*|}
\]

(3.58)

**An electron moving near the top of an allowed energy band moves in the same direction as the applied electric field.**

The net motion of electrons in a nearly full band can be described by considering just the empty states, provided that a positive electronic charge is associated with each state and that the negative of \( m^* \) from Equation (3.56) is associated with each state. We now can model this band as having particles with a positive electronic charge and a positive effective mass. The density of these particles in the valence band is the same as the density of empty electronic energy states. This new particle is the hole. The hole, then, has a positive effective mass denoted by \( m^*_h \) and a positive electronic charge, so it will move in the same direction as an applied field.

## 3.2.5 Metals, Insulators, and Semiconductors

Each crystal has its own energy-band structure. We noted that the splitting of the energy states in silicon, for example, to form the valence and conduction bands, was complex. Complex band splitting occurs in other crystals, leading to large variations in band structures between various solids and to a wide range of electrical characteristics observed in these various materials. We can qualitatively begin to understand some basic differences in electrical characteristics caused by variations in band structure by considering some simplified energy bands.
