## Example 8.1

### Objective

Calculate the minority carrier concentrations at the edge of the space charge regions in a forward-biased pn junction.

Consider a silicon pn junction at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \). Assume the doping concentration in the n region is \( N_D = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and the doping concentration in the p region is \( N_A = 6 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), and assume that a forward bias of 0.60 V is applied to the pn junction.

### Solution

From Equations (8.6) and (8.7) and from Figure 8.4, we have

\[
n_p(-x_p) = n_{po} \exp\left(\frac{eV}{kT}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad p_n(x_n) = p_{no} \exp\left(\frac{eV}{kT}\right)
\]

The thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentrations are

\[
n_{po} = \frac{n_i^2}{N_A} = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}{6 \times 10^{15}} = 3.75 \times 10^4 \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

and

\[
p_{no} = \frac{n_i^2}{N_D} = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}{10^{16}} = 2.25 \times 10^4 \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

We then have

\[
n_p(-x_p) = 3.75 \times 10^4 \exp\left(\frac{0.60}{0.0259}\right) = 4.31 \times 10^{14} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

and

\[
p_n(x_n) = 2.25 \times 10^4 \exp\left(\frac{0.60}{0.0259}\right) = 2.59 \times 10^{14} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

### Comment

The minority carrier concentrations can increase by many orders of magnitude when a relatively small forward-bias voltage is applied. Low injection still applies, however, since the excess minority carrier concentrations at the space-charge edges are much less than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentrations.
