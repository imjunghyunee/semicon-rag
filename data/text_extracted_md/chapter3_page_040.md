----

**Objective:** Determine the energy at which the Boltzmann approximation may be considered valid.

**EXAMPLE 3.8**

Calculate the energy, in terms of \(kT\) and \(E_F\), at which the difference between the Boltzmann approximation and the Fermi–Dirac function is 5 percent of the Fermi function.

**Solution**

We can write

\[
\exp\left[-\frac{(E - E_F)}{kT}\right] = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left[\frac{E - E_F}{kT}\right]} = 0.05
\]

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \exp\left[\frac{E - E_F}{kT}\right]}
\]

If we multiply both numerator and denominator by the \(1 + \exp()\) function, we have

\[
\exp\left[-\frac{(E - E_F)}{kT}\right] \cdot \left\{1 + \exp\left[\frac{E - E_F}{kT}\right]\right\} - 1 = 0.05
\]

which becomes

\[
\exp\left[-\frac{(E - E_F)}{kT}\right] = 0.05
\]

or

\[
(E - E_F) = kT \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.05}\right) \approx 3kT
\]

**Comment**

As seen in this example and in Figure 3.35, the \(E - E_F \gg kT\) notation is somewhat misleading. The Maxwell–Boltzmann and Fermi–Dirac functions are within 5 percent of each other when \(E - E_F \approx 3kT\).

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**

Ex 3.8 Repeat Example 3.8 for the case when the difference between the Boltzmann approximation and the Fermi–Dirac function is 2 percent of the Fermi function.

\[
\left(\frac{1}{0.02} = 4.7 \approx 5\right)
\]
