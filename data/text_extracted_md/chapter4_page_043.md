# CHAPTER 4 The Semiconductor in Equilibrium

- The concept of doping the semiconductor with donor (group V elements) impurities and acceptor (group III elements) impurities to form n-type and p-type extrinsic semiconductors was discussed.
- The fundamental relationship of \( n_0 p_0 = n_i^2 \) was derived.
- Using the concepts of complete ionization and charge neutrality, equations for the electron and hole concentrations as a function of impurity doping concentrations were derived.
- The position of the Fermi energy level as a function of impurity doping concentrations was derived.
- The relevance of the Fermi energy was discussed. The Fermi energy is a constant throughout a semiconductor that is in thermal equilibrium.

## GLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS

**acceptor atoms**  
Impurity atoms added to a semiconductor to create a p-type material.

**charge carrier**  
The electron and/or hole that moves inside the semiconductor and gives rise to electrical currents.

**compensated semiconductor**  
A semiconductor that contains both donors and acceptors in the same semiconductor region.

**complete ionization**  
The condition when all donor atoms are positively charged by giving up their donor electrons and all acceptor atoms are negatively charged by accepting electrons.

**degenerate semiconductor**  
A semiconductor whose electron concentration or hole concentration is greater than the effective density of states, so that the Fermi level is in the conduction band (n type) or in the valence band (p type).

**donor atoms**  
Impurity atoms added to a semiconductor to create an n-type material.

**effective density of states**  
The parameter \( N_c \), which results from integrating the density of quantum states \( g_c(E) \) times the Fermi function \( f(E) \) over the conduction-band energy, and the parameter \( N_v \), which results from integrating the density of quantum states \( g_v(E) \) times \([1 - f_v(E)]\) over the valence-band energy.

**extrinsic semiconductor**  
A semiconductor in which controlled amounts of donors and/or acceptors have been added so that the electron and hole concentrations change from the intrinsic carrier concentration and a preponderance of either electrons (n type) or holes (p type) is created.

**freeze-out**  
The condition that occurs in a semiconductor when the temperature is lowered and the donors and acceptors become neutrally charged. The electron and hole concentrations become very small.

## CHECKPOINT

- Derive the equation for the intrinsic carrier concentration.
- Discuss what is meant by the effective density of states for electrons and holes.
- Describe the effect of adding donor and acceptor impurity atoms to a semiconductor.
