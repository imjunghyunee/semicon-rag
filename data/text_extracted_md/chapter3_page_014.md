## 3.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands

or

\[
E_g = \frac{4.986 \times 10^{-19}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 3.12 \, \text{eV}
\]

**Comment**

The results of this example give an order of magnitude of forbidden energy band widths.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 3.2** Using the parameters given in Example 3.2, determine the width of the allowed energy band in the range \(\pi < ka < 2\pi\).

Consider again the right side of Equation (3.24), which is the function \(\cos ka\). The cosine function is periodic so that

\[
\cos ka = \cos(ka + 2\pi n) = \cos(ka - 2\pi n)
\]

where \(n\) is a positive integer. We may consider Figure 3.9 and displace portions of the curve by \(2\pi\). Mathematically, Equation (3.24) is still satisfied. Figure 3.10 shows how various segments of the curve can be displaced by the \(2\pi\) factor. Figure 3.11 shows the case in which the entire \(E\) versus \(k\) plot is contained within \(-\pi/a < k < \pi/a\). This plot is referred to as a reduced \(k\)-space diagram, or a reduced-zone representation.

We noted in Equation (3.27) that for a free electron, the particle momentum and the wave number \(k\) are related by \(p = \hbar k\). Given the similarity between the free
