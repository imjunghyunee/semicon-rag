# CHAPTER 11 Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor: Additional Concepts

approximately 9 eV. The figure schematically shows the creation of an electron–hole pair in the oxide by ionizing radiation. The force on the radiation-induced electron is toward the gate and the force on the radiation-induced hole is toward the semiconductor. It has been found that generated electrons in the oxide are fairly mobile, with a mobility value on the order of 20 cm\(^2\)/V·s. At high electric fields, the electron velocity in the oxide also saturates at approximately 10\(^7\) cm/s, so that the electron transit time for typical gate oxide thicknesses is on the order of a few picoseconds. For positive gate voltages, the vast majority of radiation-induced electrons flow out through the gate terminal; for this reason, in general these electrons do not play a significant role in the radiation response of MOS devices.

The generated holes, on the other hand, undergo a stochastic hopping transport process through the oxide (shown schematically in Figure 11.30). The hole transport process is dispersive in time and is a function of the electric field, temperature, and oxide thickness. The effective hole mobility in silicon dioxide is typically in the range of 10\(^-4\) to 10\(^-11\) cm\(^2\)/V·s; thus, holes are relatively immobile when compared with electrons.

When holes reach the silicon–silicon dioxide (Si–SiO\(_2\)) interface, a fraction are captured in trapping sites while the remainder flow into the silicon. A net positive radiation-induced charge is then trapped in the oxide due to these captured holes. This trapped charge can last from hours to years. As we have seen, a positive oxide charge causes a negative shift in threshold voltage.

The measured areal hole trap densities are in the range of 10\(^12\) to 10\(^13\) cm\(^-2\) depending upon oxide and device processing. In general, these traps are located within approximately 50 Å of the Si–SiO\(_2\) interface. The hole trap is usually associated with a trivalent silicon defect that has an oxygen vacancy in the SiO\(_2\) structure. The oxygen vacancies are located in a silicon-rich region near the Si–SiO\(_2\) interface.

Since the threshold or flat-band voltage shift is a function of the amount of trapped charge, the voltage shift is a function of applied voltage across the oxide. Figure 11.31 shows the flat-band voltage shift of an MOS capacitor as a function of gate voltage applied during irradiation. For small values of gate voltage, some radiation-generated
