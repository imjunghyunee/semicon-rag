# Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

the interface, a negative space charge region is created because of the fixed ionized acceptor atoms. The negative charge in the induced depletion region corresponds to the negative charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor. Figure 10.3b shows the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this applied voltage.

The energy-band diagrams of the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for various gate biases are shown in Figure 10.4. Figure 10.4a shows the ideal case when zero bias is applied across the MOS device. The energy bands in the semiconductor are flat indicating no net charge exists in the semiconductor. This condition is known as flat band and is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.
