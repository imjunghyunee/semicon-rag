# PROBLEMS

(Note: Assume \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) for the following problems unless otherwise stated.)

## Section 13.1 JFET Concepts

**13.1** (a) Draw the structure of a p-channel JFET similar to the structure shown in Figure P13.2. (b) Qualitatively discuss the I–V characteristics, including current directions and voltage polarities, similar to those shown in Figures 13.3 and 13.4.

**13.2** Consider the n-channel JFET in Figure P13.2. The p-type substrate is connected to the n-type source terminal. Sketch the space charge regions for various \( V_{GS} \) values when \( V_{DS} = 0 \) and for various \( V_{DS} \) values when \( V_{GS} = 0 \).

## Section 13.2 The Device Characteristics

**13.3** An n-channel GaAs pn JFET at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) has parameters \( N_d = 3 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), \( N_a = 2 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), and \( a = 0.40 \, \mu\text{m} \). (a) Calculate the (i) internal pinch-off voltage \( V_{po} \) and (ii) pinch-off voltage \( V_p \). (b) Determine the minimum undepleted channel thickness, \( a - h \), for \( V_{DS} = -0.5 \, \text{V} \) and for (i) \( V_{GS} = 0 \), (ii) \( V_{GS} = 0.5 \, \text{V} \), and (iii) \( V_{GS} = 2.5 \, \text{V} \). (c) Find \( V_{DS}(sat) \) for (i) \( V_{GS} = 0 \) and (ii) \( V_{GS} = -1.0 \, \text{V} \).

**13.4** Repeat Problem 13.3 for an n-channel silicon pn JFET with the same geometrical and electrical parameters.

**13.5** Consider a p-channel GaAs pn JFET at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \). The parameters are \( N_a = 10^{18} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( a = 0.65 \, \mu\text{m} \). (a) Determine the channel doping concentration such that the internal pinch-off voltage is \( V_{po} = 2.75 \, \text{V} \). (b) Using the results of part (a), what is the pinch-off voltage \( V_p \)? (c) For \( V_{DS} = 0 \), determine the value of \( V_{GS} \) such that the minimum undepleted channel thickness is \( 0.15 \, \mu\text{m} \). (d) For \( V_{GS} = 0 \), find the value of \( V_{DS} \) such that the channel is just pinched off at the drain terminal.
