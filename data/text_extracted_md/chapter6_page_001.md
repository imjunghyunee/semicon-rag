## Nonequilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

Our discussion of the physics of semiconductors in Chapter 4 was based on thermal equilibrium. When a voltage is applied or a current exists in a semiconductor device, the semiconductor is operating under nonequilibrium conditions. In our discussion of current transport in Chapter 5, we did not address nonequilibrium conditions but implicitly assumed that equilibrium was not significantly disturbed. Excess electrons in the conduction band and excess holes in the valence band may exist in addition to the thermal-equilibrium concentrations if an external excitation is applied to the semiconductor. In this chapter, we discuss the behavior of nonequilibrium electron and hole concentrations as functions of time and space coordinates.

Excess electrons and excess holes do not move independently of each other. These excess carriers diffuse, drift, and recombine with the same effective diffusion coefficient, drift mobility, and lifetime. This phenomenon is called ambipolar transport. We develop the ambipolar transport equation that describes the behavior of excess electrons and holes. Excess carriers dominate the electrical properties of a semiconductor material, and the behavior of excess carriers is fundamental to the operation of semiconductor devices.

In this chapter, we will:

- Describe the process of generation and recombination of excess carriers in a semiconductor.
- Define the recombination rate and generation rate of excess carriers, and define the excess carrier lifetime.
- Discuss why excess electrons and excess holes do not move independently of each other. The movement of excess carriers is called **ambipolar transport**, and the ambipolar transport equation is derived.
