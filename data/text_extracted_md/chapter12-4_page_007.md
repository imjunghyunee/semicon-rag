A smaller junction capacitance increases the speed of the device. Also, for the GaAs npn device, the minority carriers in the base are electrons with a high mobility. The electron mobility in GaAs is approximately five times that in silicon; thus, the base transit time in the GaAs base is very short. Experimental AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction transistors with base widths on the order of 0.1 μm have shown cutoff frequencies on the order of 40 GHz.

One disadvantage of GaAs is the low minority carrier lifetime. The small lifetime is not a factor in the base of a narrow-base device, but results in a larger B–E recombination current, which decreases the recombination factor and reduces the current gain. A current gain of 150 has been reported.
