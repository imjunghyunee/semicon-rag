## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

The goal of this text is to help readers understand the operation and characteristics of semiconductor devices. Ideally, we would like to begin discussing these devices immediately. However, in order to understand the current-voltage characteristics, we need some knowledge of electron behavior in a semiconductor when the electron is subjected to various potential functions.

The motion of large objects, such as planets and satellites, can be predicted to a high degree of accuracy using classical theoretical physics based on Newton’s laws of motion. But certain experimental results, involving electrons and light waves, appear to be inconsistent with classical physics. However, these experimental results can be predicted using the principles of quantum mechanics. The behavior and characteristics of electrons in a semiconductor can be described by the formulation of quantum mechanics called wave mechanics. The essential elements of this wave mechanics, using Schrödinger’s wave equation, are presented in this chapter.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction to quantum mechanics so that readers gain an understanding of and become comfortable with the analysis techniques. This introductory material forms the basis of semiconductor physics.
