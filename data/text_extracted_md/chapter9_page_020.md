From the semiconductor into the metal. Figure 9.12b shows the case when a positive voltage is applied to the semiconductor with respect to the metal. Electrons can easily flow over the barrier from the metal into the semiconductor. This junction, then, is an ohmic contact.

Figure 9.13 shows an ideal nonrectifying contact between a metal and a p-type semiconductor. Figure 9.13a shows the energy levels before contact for the case when \(\phi_m > \phi_b\). When contact is made, electrons from the semiconductor flow into the metal to achieve thermal equilibrium, leaving behind more empty states, or holes. The excess concentration of holes at the surface makes the surface of the semiconductor more p-type. Electrons from the metal can readily move into the empty states in the semiconductor. This charge movement corresponds to holes flowing from the semiconductor into the metal. We can also visualize holes in the metal flowing into the semiconductor. This junction is also an ohmic contact.

The ideal energy bands shown in Figures 9.11 and 9.13 do not take into account the effect of surface states. If we assume that acceptor surface states exist in
