## Optical Devices

In previous chapters, we have considered the basic physics of transistors that are used to amplify or switch electrical signals. Semiconductor devices can be designed to convert optical energy into electrical energy, and to convert electrical signals into optical signals. These devices are used in broadband communications and data transmission over optical fibers. The general classification of these devices is called **optoelectronics**.

In this chapter, we discuss the basic principles of solar cells, several photodetectors, light emitting diodes, and laser diodes. Solar cells and photodetectors convert optical energy into electrical energy; light emitting diodes and laser diodes convert electrical signals into optical signals.
