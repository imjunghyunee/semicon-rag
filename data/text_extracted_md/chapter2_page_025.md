## 2.4 Extensions of the Wave Theory to Atoms

The solution of the wave equation may be designated by \(\psi_{nlm}\), where \(n\), \(l\), and \(m\) are again the various quantum numbers. For the lowest energy state, \(n = 1\), \(l = 0\), and \(m = 0\), and the wave function is given by

\[
\psi_{100} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \left( \frac{1}{a_0} \right)^{3/2} e^{-r/a_0}
\]

(2.74)

This function is spherically symmetric, and the parameter \(a_0\) is given by

\[
a_0 = \frac{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_0 e^2} = 0.529 \, \text{Ã…}
\]

(2.75)

and is equal to the Bohr radius.

The radial probability density function, or the probability of finding the electron at a particular distance from the nucleus, is proportional to the product \(\psi_{100}^* \psi_{100}\) and also to the differential volume of the shell around the nucleus. The probability density function for the lowest energy state is plotted in Figure 2.11a. The most probable distance from the nucleus is at \(r = a_0\), which is the same as the Bohr theory. Considering this spherically symmetric probability function, we may now begin to conceive the concept of an electron cloud, or energy shell, surrounding the nucleus rather than a discrete particle orbiting around the nucleus.

The radial probability density function for the next higher, spherically symmetric wave function, corresponding to \(n = 2\), \(l = 0\), and \(m = 0\), is shown in Figure 2.11b. This figure shows the idea of the next-higher energy shell of the electron. The second energy shell is at a greater radius from the nucleus than the first energy shell. As indicated in the figure, though, there is still a small probability that the electron will exist at the smaller radius. For the case of \(n = 2\) and \(l = 1\), there are three possible states corresponding to the three allowed values of the quantum number \(m\). These wave functions are no longer spherically symmetric.

Although we have not gone into a great deal of mathematical detail for the one-electron atom, three results are important for the further analysis of semiconductor materials.
