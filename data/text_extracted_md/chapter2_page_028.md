# Chapter 2: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

**quantum state**  
A particular state of an electron that may be described, for example, by a set of quantum numbers.

**tunneling**  
The quantum mechanical phenomenon by which a particle may penetrate through a thin potential barrier.

**wave–particle duality**  
The characteristic by which electromagnetic waves sometimes exhibit particle-like behavior and particles sometimes exhibit wave-like behavior.

## CHECKPOINT

After studying this chapter, the reader should have the ability to:

- Discuss the principle of energy quanta, the wave–particle duality principle, and the uncertainty principle.
- Apply Schrödinger’s wave equation and boundary conditions to problems with various potential functions.
- Determine quantized energy levels of bound particles.
- Determine the approximate tunneling probability of a particle incident on a potential barrier.
- State Pauli exclusion principle.
- Discuss the results of the one-electron atom analysis, including quantum numbers and their interrelationships as well as the initial formation of the periodic table.

## REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. State the wave–particle duality principle and state the relationship between momentum and wavelength.
2. What is the physical meaning of Schrödinger’s wave function?
3. What is meant by a probability density function?
4. List the boundary conditions for solutions to Schrödinger’s wave equation.
5. What is meant by quantized energy levels? Can an electron contained in a potential well have an arbitrary energy?
6. Describe the concept of tunneling.
7. List the quantum numbers of the one-electron atom and discuss how they were developed.
8. State the interrelationship between the quantum numbers of the one-electron atom and how this result leads to, for example, the development of inert elements.

## PROBLEMS

2.1 The classical wave equation for a two-wire transmission line is given by 

\[
\partial^2 V(x, t) / \partial x^2 = LC \cdot \partial^2 V(x, t) / \partial t^2
\]

One possible solution is given by 

\[
V(x, t) = (\sin Kx) \cdot (\sin \omega t)
\]

where \( K = m\pi / a \) and \( \omega = K / \sqrt{LC} \). Sketch, on the same graph, the function \( V(x, t) \) as a function of \( x \) for \( 0 \leq x \leq a \) and \( n = 1 \) when (i) \( \omega t = 0 \), (ii) \( \omega t = \pi/2 \), (iii) \( \omega t = \pi \), (iv) \( \omega t = 3\pi/2 \), and (v) \( \omega t = 2\pi \).

2.2 The function \( V(x, t) = \cos (2\pi x/\lambda - \omega t) \) is also a solution to the classical wave equation. Sketch on the same graph the function \( V(x, t) \) as a function of \( x \) for \( 0 \leq x \leq \lambda \) when: (i) \( \omega t = 0 \), (ii) \( \omega t = 0.25\pi \), (iii) \( \omega t = 0.5\pi \), (iv) \( \omega t = 0.75\pi \), and (v) \( \omega t = \pi \).

2.3 Repeat Problem 2.2 for the function \( V(x, t) = \cos (2\pi x/\lambda + \omega t) \).

2.4 Determine the phase velocities of the traveling waves described in Problems 2.2 and 2.3.
