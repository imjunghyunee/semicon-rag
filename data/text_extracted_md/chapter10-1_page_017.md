where \( C_{\text{ox}} \) is the oxide capacitance per unit area. Substituting Equation (10.22) into Equation (10.23), we have

\[
V_{\text{ox}} = -\frac{Q'_{\text{ox}}}{C_{\text{ox}}}
\]

(10.24)

In the flat-band condition, the surface potential is zero, or \( \phi_s = 0 \). Then from Equation (10.21), we have

\[
V_G = V_{FB} = \phi_{ms} - \frac{Q'_{\text{ox}}}{C_{\text{ox}}}
\]

Equation (10.25) is the flat-band voltage for this MOS device.

## Objective

Calculate the flat-band voltage for a MOS capacitor with a p-type semiconductor substrate.

**Example 10.3**

Consider a MOS capacitor with a p-type silicon substrate doped to \( N_a = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), a silicon dioxide insulator with a thickness of \( t_{\text{ox}} = 20 \, \text{nm} = 200 \, \text{Ã…} \), and an n\(^+\) polysilicon gate. Assume that \( Q'_{\text{ox}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \) electronic charges per cm\(^2\).

### Solution

The work function difference, from Figure 10.16, is \( \phi_{ms} = -1.1 \, \text{V} \). The oxide capacitance is found to be

\[
C_{\text{ox}} = \frac{\varepsilon_{\text{ox}}}{t_{\text{ox}}} = \frac{(3.9)(8.85 \times 10^{-14})}{200 \times 10^{-8}} = 1.726 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{F/cm}^2
\]

The equivalent oxide charge density is

\[
Q'_{\text{ox}} = (5 \times 10^{10})(1.6 \times 10^{-19}) = 8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/cm}^2
\]

The flat-band voltage is then determined to be

\[
V_{FB} = \phi_{ms} - \frac{Q'_{\text{ox}}}{C_{\text{ox}}} = -1.1 - \frac{8 \times 10^{-9}}{1.726 \times 10^{-7}} = -1.15 \, \text{V}
\]
