# 14.1 OPTICAL ABSORPTION

In Chapter 2, we discussed the wave–particle duality principle and indicated that light waves could be treated as particles, which are referred to as photons. The energy of a photon is \( E = h\nu \) where \( h \) is Planck’s constant and \( \nu \) is the frequency. We can also relate the wavelength and energy by

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu} = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1.24}{E} \, \text{μm}
\]

(14.1)

where \( E \) is the photon energy in eV and \( c \) is the speed of light.

There are several possible photon–semiconductor interaction mechanisms. For example, photons can interact with the semiconductor lattice whereby the photon energy is converted into heat. Photons can also interact with impurity atoms, either donors or acceptors, or they can interact with defects within the semiconductor. However, the basic photon interaction process of greatest interest is the interaction with valence electrons. When a photon collides with a valence electron, enough energy may be imparted to elevate the electron into the conduction band. Such a process generates electron–hole pairs and creates excess carrier concentrations. The behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor was considered in Chapter 6.

## 14.1.1 Photon Absorption Coefficient

When a semiconductor is illuminated with light, the photons may be absorbed or they may propagate through the semiconductor, depending on the photon energy and on the bandgap energy \( E_g \). If the photon energy is less than \( E_g \), the photons are not readily absorbed. In this case, the light is transmitted through the material and the semiconductor appears to be transparent.

If \( E = h\nu > E_g \), the photon can interact with a valence electron and elevate the electron into the conduction band. The valence band contains many electrons and the conduction band contains many empty states, so the probability of this interaction is high when \( h\nu > E_g \). This interaction creates an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band—an electron–hole pair. The basic absorption processes for different values of \( h\nu \) are shown in Figure 14.1. When \( h\nu > E_g \), an electron–hole pair is generated.
