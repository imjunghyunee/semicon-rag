## 4.7 | SUMMARY

- The concentration of electrons in the conduction band is the integral over the conduction-band energy of the product of the density of states function in the conduction band and the Fermi–Dirac probability function.

- The concentration of holes in the valence band is the integral over the valence-band energy of the product of the density of states function in the valence band and the probability of a state being empty, which is \([1 - f_F(E)]\).

- Using the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation, the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons in the conduction band is given by

  \[
  n_0 = N_c \exp\left[-\frac{(E_c - E_F)}{kT}\right]
  \]

  where \(N_c\) is the effective density of states in the conduction band.

- Using the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation, the thermal-equilibrium concentration of holes in the valence band is given by

  \[
  p_0 = N_v \exp\left[-\frac{(E_F - E_v)}{kT}\right]
  \]

  where \(N_v\) is the effective density of states in the valence band.

- The intrinsic carrier concentration is found from

  \[
  n_i^2 = N_c N_v \exp\left[-\frac{E_g}{kT}\right]
  \]
