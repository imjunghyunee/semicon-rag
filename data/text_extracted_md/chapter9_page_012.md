**TYU 9.3** Determine the Schottky barrier lowering and the position of the maximum barrier height for the junction described in TYU 9.1. Use the value of the electric field found in TYU 9.1. (γ \[ε = "κ" \]ΛΦ 6200 = ΦΨ ΨΨ)

## 9.1.4 Current–Voltage Relationship

The current transport in a metal–semiconductor junction is due mainly to majority carriers as opposed to minority carriers in a pn junction. The basic process in the rectifying contact with an n-type semiconductor is by transport of electrons over the potential barrier, which can be described by the thermionic emission theory.

The thermionic emission characteristics are derived by assuming that the barrier height is much larger than \(kT\), so that the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation applies and that thermal equilibrium is not affected by this process. Figure 9.7 shows the one-dimensional barrier with an applied forward-bias voltage \(V_a\) and two electron current density components. The current \(J_{s,em}\) is the electron current density due to the flow of electrons from the semiconductor into the metal, and the current \(J_{s,m}\) is the electron current density due to the flow of electrons from the metal into the semiconductor. The subscripts of the currents indicate the direction of electron flow. The conventional current direction is opposite to electron flow.
