The first is the solution of Schr√∂dinger's wave equation, which again yields electron probability functions, as it did for the simpler potential functions. In developing the physics of semiconductor materials in later chapters, we will also be considering electron probability functions. The second result is the quantization of allowed energy levels for the bound electron. The third is the concept of quantum numbers and quantum states, which evolved from the separation-of-variables technique. We will consider this concept again in the next section and in later chapters when we deal with the semiconductor material physics.

## 2.4.2 The Periodic Table

The initial portion of the periodic table of elements may be determined by using the results of the one-electron atom plus two additional concepts. The first concept needed is that of **electron spin**. The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, which is quantized and may take on one of two possible values. The spin is designated by a quantum number \( s \), which has a value of \( s = +\frac{1}{2} \) or \( s = -\frac{1}{2} \). We now have four basic quantum numbers: \( n, l, m, \) and \( s \).

The second concept needed is the **Pauli exclusion principle**. The Pauli exclusion principle states that, in any given system (an atom, molecule, or crystal), no two electrons may occupy the same quantum state. In an atom, the exclusion principle means that no two electrons may have the same set of quantum numbers. We will see that the exclusion principle is also an important factor in determining the distribution of electrons among available energy states in a crystal.

Table 2.1 shows the first few elements of the periodic table. For the first element, hydrogen, we have one electron in the lowest energy state corresponding to \( n = 1 \). From Equation (2.72) both quantum numbers \( l \) and \( m \) must be zero. However, the electron can take on either spin factor \( +\frac{1}{2} \) or \( -\frac{1}{2} \). For helium, two electrons may exist in the lowest energy state. For this case, \( l = m = 0 \), so now both electron spin states are occupied and the lowest energy shell is full. The chemical activity of an element is determined primarily by the valence, or outermost, electrons. Since the valence energy shell of helium is full, helium does not react with other elements and is an inert element.
