When the distribution of these electrons among the quantum states at \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \) is shown by the dashed line, the electrons are in the lowest possible energy state so that all states below \( E_F \) are filled and all states above \( E_F \) are empty. If \( g(E) \) and \( N_s \) are known for this particular system, then the Fermi energy \( E_F \) can be determined.

Consider the situation when the temperature increases above \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \). Electrons gain a certain amount of thermal energy so that some electrons can jump to higher energy levels, which means that the distribution of electrons among the available energy states will change. Figure 3.32 shows the same discrete energy levels and quantum states as in Figure 3.30. The distribution of electrons among the quantum states has changed from the \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \) case. Two electrons from the \( E_4 \) level have gained enough energy to jump to \( E_5 \), and one electron from \( E_2 \) has jumped to \( E_4 \). As the temperature changes, the distribution of electrons versus energy changes.

The change in the electron distribution among energy levels for \( T > 0 \, \text{K} \) can be seen by plotting the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. If we let \( E = E_F \) and \( T > 0 \, \text{K} \), then Equation (3.79) becomes

\[
f_k(E = E_F) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(0)} = \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of a state being occupied at \( E = E_F \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \). Figure 3.33 shows the Fermi–Dirac distribution function plotted for several temperatures, assuming that the Fermi energy is independent of temperature.
