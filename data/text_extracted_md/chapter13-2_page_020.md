# Chapter 13: The Junction Field-Effect Transistor

### Key Terms

- **Channel length modulation**: The change in effective channel length with drain-to-source voltage with the JFET biased in the saturation region.

- **Conduction parameter**: The multiplying factor \( k_n \) in the expression for drain current versus gate-to-source voltage for the enhancement mode MESFET.

- **Cutoff frequency**: A figure of merit for the transistor defined to be the frequency at which the ratio of the small-signal input gate current to small-signal drain current is equal to unity.

- **Depletion mode JFET**: A JFET in which a gate-to-source voltage must be applied to create pinch-off and turn the device off.

- **Enhancement mode JFET**: A JFET in which pinch-off exists at zero gate voltage and a gate-to-source voltage must be applied to induce a channel, turning the device on.

- **Internal pinch-off voltage**: The total potential drop across the gate junction at pinch-off.

- **Output resistance**: The ratio of a differential change in drain-to-source voltage to the corresponding differential change in drain current at a constant gate-to-source voltage.

- **Pinch-off**: The condition whereby the gate junction space charge region extends completely through the channel so that the channel is completely depleted of free carriers.
