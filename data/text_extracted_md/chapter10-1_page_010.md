## 10.1.3 Surface Charge Density

From the results of Chapter 4, the electron concentration in the conduction band can be written in the form

\[
n = n_i \exp \left[ \frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \right]
\]

(10.9)

For a p-type semiconductor substrate, the electron inversion charge density can then be written as (see Figure 10.9)

\[
n_s = n_i \exp \left[ \frac{e(\phi_s + \Delta \phi_s)}{kT} \right] = n_i \exp \left[ \frac{\phi_s + \Delta \phi_s}{V_t} \right]
\]
