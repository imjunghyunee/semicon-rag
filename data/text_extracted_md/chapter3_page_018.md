### 3.2 Electrical Conduction in Solids

The electron distribution in the conduction band may look like that shown in Figure 3.15, which implies that the electrons have gained a net momentum.

We may write the drift current density due to the motion of electrons as

\[
J = -e \sum_{i} n_i v_i
\]

(3.35)

where \( e \) is the magnitude of the electronic charge and \( n \) is the number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band. Again, the summation is taken over a unit volume so that the current density is still in units of A/cm\(^2\). We may note from Equation (3.35) that the current is directly related to the electron velocity; that is, the current is related to how well the electron can move in the crystal.

#### 3.2.3 Electron Effective Mass

The movement of an electron in a lattice will, in general, be different from that of an electron in free space. In addition to an externally applied force, there are internal forces in the crystal due to positively charged ions or protons and negatively charged electrons, which will influence the motion of electrons in the lattice. We can write

\[
F_{\text{total}} = F_{\text{ext}} + F_{\text{int}} = ma
\]

(3.36)

where \( F_{\text{total}}, F_{\text{ext}}, \) and \( F_{\text{int}} \) are the total force, the externally applied force, and the internal forces, respectively, acting on a particle in a crystal. The parameter \( a \) is the acceleration and \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle.

Since it is difficult to take into account all of the internal forces, we will write the equation

\[
F_{\text{ext}} = m^* a
\]

(3.37)

where the acceleration \( a \) is now directly related to the external force. The parameter \( m^* \), called the effective mass, takes into account the particle mass and also takes into account the effect of the internal forces.

To use an analogy for the effective mass concept, consider the difference in motion between a glass marble in a container filled with water and in a container filled with oil. In general, the marble will drop through the water at a faster rate than through the oil. The external force in this example is the gravitational force and the internal...
