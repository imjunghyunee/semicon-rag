## 3.4 Density of States Function

The general form of the \( E \) versus \( k \) relation for an electron in the bottom of a conduction band is the same as the free electron, except the mass is replaced by the effective mass. We can then think of the electron in the bottom of the conduction band as being a "free" electron with its own particular mass. The right side of Equation (3.71) is of the same form as the right side of Equation (3.28), which was used in the derivation of the density of states function. Because of this similarity, which yields the "free" conduction electron model, we may generalize the free electron results of Equation (3.69) and write the density of allowed electronic energy states in the conduction band as

\[
g_c(E) = \frac{4\pi(2m_n)^{3/2}}{h^3} \sqrt{E - E_c}
\]

(3.72)

Equation (3.72) is valid for \( E \geq E_c \). As the energy of the electron in the conduction band decreases, the number of available quantum states also decreases.

The density of quantum states in the valence band can be obtained by using the same infinite potential well model, since the hole is also confined in the semiconductor crystal and can be treated as a "free" particle. The density of states effective mass of the hole is \( m_p^* \). Figure 3.16b shows the valence energy band in the reduced \( k \) space. We may also approximate the \( E \) versus \( k \) curve near \( k = 0 \) by a parabola for a "free" hole, so that

\[
E = E_v - \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_p^*}
\]

(3.73)

Equation (3.73) may be rewritten to give

\[
E_v - E = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_p^*}
\]

(3.74)

Again, the right side of Equation (3.74) is of the same form used in the general derivation of the density of states function. We may then generalize the density of states function from Equation (3.69) to apply to the valence band, so that

\[
g_v(E) = \frac{4\pi(2m_p^*)^{3/2}}{h^3} \sqrt{E_v - E}
\]

(3.75)

Equation (3.75) is valid for \( E \leq E_v \).

We have argued that quantum states do not exist within the forbidden energy band, so \( g(E) = 0 \) for \( E_c < E < E_v \). Figure 3.27 shows the plot of the density of quantum states as a function of energy. If the electron and hole effective masses were equal, then the functions \( g_c(E) \) and \( g_v(E) \) would be symmetrical about the energy midway between \( E_c \) and \( E_v \), or the midgap energy, \( E_{\text{midgap}} \).
