## Table 4.4 Impurity Ionization Energies in Gallium Arsenide

| Impurity   | Ionization Energy (eV) |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Donors** |                        |
| Selenium   | 0.0059                 |
| Tellurium  | 0.0058                 |
| Silicon    | 0.0058                 |
| Germanium  | 0.0061                 |
| **Acceptors** |                     |
| Beryllium  | 0.028                  |
| Zinc       | 0.0307                 |
| Cadmium    | 0.0347                 |
| Silicon    | 0.0345                 |
| Germanium  | 0.0404                 |

The ionization energies for donors are smaller than those for the acceptors, because of the smaller effective mass of the electron compared to that of the hole.

Group IV elements, such as silicon and germanium, can also be impurity atoms in gallium arsenide. If a silicon atom replaces a gallium atom, the silicon impurity will act as a donor, but if the silicon atom replaces an arsenic atom, then the silicon impurity will act as an acceptor. The same is true for germanium as an impurity atom. Such impurities are called amphoteric. Experimentally in gallium arsenide, it is found that germanium is predominantly an acceptor and silicon is predominantly a donor. Table 4.4 lists the ionization energies for the various impurity atoms in gallium arsenide.

## 4.3.1 The Extrinsic Semiconductor

We defined an intrinsic semiconductor as a material with no impurity atoms present in the crystal. An extrinsic semiconductor is defined as a semiconductor in which controlled amounts of specific dopant or impurity atoms have been added so that the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are different from the intrinsic carrier concentration. One type of carrier will predominate in an extrinsic semiconductor.

### 4.3.1 Equilibrium Distribution of Electrons and Holes

Adding donor or acceptor impurity atoms to a semiconductor will change the distribution of electrons and holes in the material. Since the Fermi energy is related to the distribution function, the Fermi energy will change as dopant atoms are added.
