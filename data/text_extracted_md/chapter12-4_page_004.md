# 12.8.2 Silicon–Germanium Base Transistor

The bandgap energy of germanium (Ge) (~0.67 eV) is significantly smaller than the bandgap energy of silicon (Si) (~1.12 eV). By incorporating Ge into Si, the bandgap energy will decrease compared to pure Si. If Ge is incorporated into the base region of a Si bipolar transistor, the decrease in bandgap energy will influence the device characteristics. The desired Ge concentration profile is to have the largest amount of Ge near the base–collector junction and the least amount of Ge near the base–emitter junction. Figure 12.48a shows an ideal uniform boron doping concentration in the p-type base and a linear Ge concentration profile.

The energy bands of a SiGe-base npn transistor compared to a Si-base npn transistor, assuming the boron and Ge concentration given in Figure 12.48a, are shown in Figure 12.48b. The emitter–base junctions of the two transistors are essentially identical, since the Ge concentration is very small in this region. However, the bandgap energy of the SiGe-base transistor near the base–collector junction is smaller than that of the Si-base transistor. The base current is determined by the base–emitter junction parameters and hence will be essentially the same in the two transistors. This change in bandgap energy will influence the collector current.
