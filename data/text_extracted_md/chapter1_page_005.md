# 1.3 Space Lattices

!Figure 1.5  
**Figure 1.5** | Three lattice types: (a) simple cubic, (b) body-centered cubic, (c) face-centered cubic.

The lattice constant of each unit cell in Figure 1.5 is designated as "a." The simple cubic (sc) structure has an atom located at each corner; the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure has an additional atom at the center of the cube; and the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure has additional atoms on each face plane.

By knowing the crystal structure of a material and its lattice dimensions, we can determine several characteristics of the crystal. For example, we can determine the volume density of atoms.

## Objective: Find the volume density of atoms in a crystal.

Consider a single-crystal material that is a body-centered cubic, as shown in Figure 1.5b, with a lattice constant \( a = 5 \, \text{Å} = 5 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \). A corner atom is shared by eight unit cells that meet at each corner so that each corner atom effectively contributes one-eighth of its volume to each unit cell. The eight corner atoms then contribute an equivalent of one atom to the unit cell. If we add the body-centered atom to the corner atoms, each unit cell contains an equivalent of two atoms.

### Solution

The number of atoms per unit cell is:

\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 8 + 1 = 2
\]

The volume density of atoms is then found as:

\[
\text{Volume Density} = \frac{\# \text{atoms per unit cell}}{\text{volume of unit cell}}
\]

So,

\[
\text{Volume Density} = \frac{2}{a^3} = \frac{2}{(5 \times 10^{-8})^3} = 1.6 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms/cm}^3
\]

### Exercise Problem

**Ex 1.1** The lattice constant of a face-centered cubic lattice is 4.25 Å. Determine the (a) effective number of atoms per unit cell and (b) volume density of atoms.
