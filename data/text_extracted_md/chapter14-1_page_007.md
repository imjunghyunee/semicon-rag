**TYU 14.1**  
(a) A photon flux with an intensity of \( I_0 = 0.10 \, \text{W/cm}^2 \) is incident on the surface of silicon. The wavelength of the incident photon signal is \( \lambda = 1 \, \mu\text{m} \). Neglecting any reflection from the surface, determine the photon flux intensity at a depth of (i) \( x = 5 \, \mu\text{m} \) and (ii) \( x = 20 \, \mu\text{m} \) from the surface. (b) Repeat part (a) for a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.60 \, \mu\text{m} \).

## 14.2 | SOLAR CELLS

A solar cell is a pn junction device with no voltage directly applied across the junction. The solar cell converts photon power into electrical power and delivers this power to a load. These devices have long been used for the power supply of satellites and space vehicles, and also as the power supply to some calculators. We will first consider the simple pn junction solar cell with uniform generation of excess carriers. We will also discuss briefly the heterojunction and amorphous silicon solar cells.

### 14.2.1 The pn Junction Solar Cell

Consider the pn junction shown in Figure 14.6 with a resistive load. Even with zero bias applied to the junction, an electric field exists in the space charge region as shown in the figure. Incident photon illumination can create electronâ€“hole pairs in the space charge region that will be swept out producing the photocurrent \( I_L \) in the reverse-biased direction as shown.

The photocurrent \( I_L \) produces a voltage drop across the resistive load which forward biases the pn junction. The forward-bias voltage produces a forward-bias current \( I_F \) as indicated in the figure. The net pn junction current, in the reverse-biased direction, is

\[
I = I_L - I_F = I_L - I_S \left[ \exp \left( \frac{eV}{kT} \right) - 1 \right]
\]
