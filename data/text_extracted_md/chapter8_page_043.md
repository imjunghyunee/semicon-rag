# 8.5 The Tunnel Diode

The **tunnel diode** is a pn junction in which both the n and p regions are degenerately doped. As we discuss the operation of this device, we will find a region that exhibits a negative differential resistance. The tunnel diode was used in oscillator circuits in the past, but other types of solid-state devices are now used as high-frequency oscillators; thus, the tunnel diode is really only of academic interest. Nevertheless, this device does demonstrate the phenomenon of tunneling we discussed in Chapter 2.

Recall the degenerately doped semiconductors we discussed in Chapter 4: the Fermi level is in the conduction band of a degenerately doped n-type material and in the valence band of a degenerately doped p-type material. Then, even at \( T = 0 \, K \), electrons will exist in the conduction band of the n-type material, and holes (empty states) will exist in the p-type material.

Figure 8.27 shows the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium for the case when both the n and p regions are degenerately doped. The depletion region width decreases as the doping increases and may be on the order of approximately 100 Å for the case shown in Figure 8.27. The potential barrier at the junction can be approximated by a triangular potential barrier, as shown in Figure 8.28. This potential barrier is similar to the potential barrier used in Chapter 2 to illustrate the tunneling phenomenon. The barrier width is small and the electric field in the space charge region is quite large; thus, a finite probability exists that an electron may tunnel through the forbidden band from one side of the junction to the other.

We may qualitatively determine the current–voltage characteristics of the tunnel diode by considering the simplified energy-band diagrams in Figure 8.29.
