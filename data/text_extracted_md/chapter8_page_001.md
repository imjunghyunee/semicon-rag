## The pn Junction Diode

In the last chapter, we discussed the electrostatics of the pn junction in thermal equilibrium and under reverse bias. We determined the built-in potential barrier at thermal equilibrium and calculated the electric field in the space charge region. We also considered the junction capacitance.

In this chapter, we consider the pn junction with a forward-bias voltage applied and determine the current–voltage characteristics. The potential barrier of the pn junction is lowered when a forward-bias voltage is applied, allowing electrons and holes to flow across the space charge region. When holes flow from the p region across the space charge region into the n region, they become excess minority carrier holes and are subject to the excess minority carrier diffusion, drift, and recombination processes discussed in Chapter 6. Likewise, when electrons from the n region flow across the space charge region into the p region, they become excess minority carrier electrons and are subject to these same processes.

In this chapter, we will:

- Consider the process by which the potential barrier of a pn junction is lowered when a forward-bias voltage is applied, so holes and electrons can flow across the junction generating a diode current.
- Derive the boundary conditions for excess holes in the n region and excess electrons in the p region, and analyze the behavior of these excess carriers under a forward bias.
- Derive the ideal current–voltage relation of the forward-biased pn junction diode.
- Describe and analyze nonideal effects in the pn junction diode such as high-level injection, and generation and recombination currents.
- Develop a small-signal equivalent circuit of the pn junction diode. This equivalent circuit is used to relate small time-varying currents and voltages in the pn junction.
