**Figure 9.18** | Ideal energy-band diagram of an nP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.

Heterojunction interface. This ideal situation is known as the **electron affinity rule**. There is still some uncertainty about the applicability of this rule, but it provides a good starting point for the discussion of heterojunctions.

Figure 9.18 shows a general ideal nP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. In order for the Fermi levels in the two materials to become aligned, electrons from the narrow-gap n region and holes from the wide-gap P region must flow across the junction. As in the case of a homojunction, this flow of charge creates a space charge region in the vicinity of the metallurgical junction. The space charge width into the n-type region is denoted by \( x_n \), and the space charge width into the P-type region is denoted by \( x_p \). The discontinuities in the conduction and valence bands and the change in the vacuum level are shown in the figure.

## 9.3.3 Two-Dimensional Electron Gas

Before we consider the electrostatics of the heterojunction, we will discuss a unique characteristic of an isotype junction. Figure 9.19 shows the energy-band diagram of an nN GaAs–AlGaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. The AlGaAs can be moderately to heavily doped n type, while the GaAs can be more lightly doped or even intrinsic. As mentioned previously, to achieve thermal equilibrium, electrons from the wide-bandgap AlGaAs flow into the GaAs, forming an accumulation layer of electrons in the potential well adjacent to the interface. One basic quantum-mechanical result that we have found previously is that the energy of an electron contained in a potential well is quantized. The phrase **two-dimensional electron gas**
