# 3.5 Statistical Mechanics

The number density \( N(E) \) is the number of particles per unit volume per unit energy and the function \( g(E) \) is the number of quantum states per unit volume per unit energy. The function \( f(E) \) is called the **Fermi–Dirac distribution** or probability function and gives the probability that a quantum state at the energy \( E \) will be occupied by an electron. The energy \( E_F \) is called the **Fermi energy**. Another interpretation of the distribution function is that \( f(E) \) is the ratio of filled to total quantum states at any energy \( E \).

## 3.5.3 The Distribution Function and the Fermi Energy

To begin to understand the meaning of the distribution function and the Fermi energy, we can plot the distribution function versus energy. Initially, let \( T = 0 \) K and consider the case when \( E < E_F \). The exponential term in Equation (3.79) becomes \(\exp[(E - E_F)/kT] = \exp(-\infty) = 0\). The resulting distribution function is \( f(E < E_F) = 1 \).

Again let \( T = 0 \) K and consider the case when \( E > E_F \). The exponential term in the distribution function becomes \(\exp[(E - E_F)/kT] = \exp(+\infty) = +\infty\). The resulting Fermi–Dirac distribution function now becomes \( f(E > E_F) = 0 \).

The Fermi–Dirac distribution function for \( T = 0 \) K is plotted in Figure 3.29. This result shows that, for \( T = 0 \) K, the electrons are in their lowest possible energy states. The probability of a quantum state being occupied is unity for \( E < E_F \) and the probability of a state being occupied is zero for \( E > E_F \). All electrons have energies below the Fermi energy at \( T = 0 \) K.

Figure 3.30 shows discrete energy levels of a particular system as well as the number of available quantum states at each energy. If we assume, for this case, that the system contains 13 electrons, then Figure 3.30 shows how these electrons are distributed among the various quantum states at \( T = 0 \) K. The electrons will be in the lowest possible energy state, so the probability of a quantum state being occupied in energy levels \( E_1 \) through \( E_3 \) is unity, and the probability of a quantum state being occupied in energy level \( E_4 \) is zero. The Fermi energy, for this case, must be above \( E_4 \) but less than \( E_5 \). The Fermi energy determines the statistical distribution of electrons and does not have to correspond to an allowed energy level.

Now consider a case in which the density of quantum states \( g(E) \) is a continuous function of energy, as shown in Figure 3.31. If we have \( N_0 \) electrons in this system,
