## 3.3.1 Extension to Three Dimensions

The basic concepts of allowed and forbidden energy bands and effective mass have been developed in the previous sections. In this section, we will extend these concepts to three dimensions and to real crystals. We will qualitatively consider particular characteristics of the three-dimensional crystal in terms of the \( E \) versus \( k \) plots, bandgap energy, and effective mass. We must emphasize that we will only briefly touch on the basic three-dimensional concepts; therefore, many details will not be considered.

One problem encountered in extending the potential function to a three-dimensional crystal is that the distance between atoms varies as the direction through the crystal changes. Figure 3.24 shows a face-centered cubic structure with the [100] and [110] directions indicated. Electrons traveling in different directions encounter different potential patterns and therefore different \( k \)-space boundaries. The \( E \) versus \( k \) diagrams are, in general, a function of the \( k \)-space direction in a crystal.

### 3.3.1.1 The \( k \)-Space Diagrams of Si and GaAs

Figure 3.25 shows an \( E \) versus \( k \) diagram of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and of silicon (Si). These simplified diagrams show the basic properties considered in this text but do not show many of the details more appropriate for advanced-level courses.

Note that in place of the usual positive and negative \( k \) axes, we now show two different crystal directions. The \( E \) versus \( k \) diagram for the one-dimensional model was symmetric in \( k \) so that no new information is obtained by displaying the negative axis. It is normal practice to plot the [100] direction along the normal \( +k \) axis and to plot the [111] portion of the diagram so the \( +k \) points to the left. In the case of diamond or zincblende lattices, the maxima in the valence band energy and minima in the conduction band energy occur at \( k = 0 \) or along one of these two directions.

Figure 3.25a shows the \( E \) versus \( k \) diagram for GaAs. The valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum both occur at \( k = 0 \). The electrons in the
