In the p material can recombine radiatively. Since \( E_g < E_{gN} \), the photons are emitted through the wide-bandgap N material with essentially no absorption. The wide bandgap N material acts as an optical window and the external quantum efficiency increases.

## 14.6 LASER DIODES

The photon output of the LED is due to an electron giving up energy as it makes a transition from the conduction band to the valence band. The LED photon emission is spontaneous in that each band-to-band transition is an independent event. The spontaneous emission process yields a spectral output of the LED with a fairly wide bandwidth. If the structure and operating condition of the LED are modified, the device can operate in a new mode, producing a coherent spectral output with a bandwidth of wavelengths less than 0.1 nm. This new device is a laser diode, where laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Although there are many different types of lasers, we are here concerned only with the pn junction laser diode.
