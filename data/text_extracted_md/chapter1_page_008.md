# The Crystal Structure of Solids

of the three dimensions and each lattice point can again be described by Equation (1.1) as

\[
\mathbf{r} = p\mathbf{a} + q\mathbf{b} + s\mathbf{c}
\]

**Each face plane of the cubic structure shown in Figure 1.8a is entirely equivalent.** These planes are grouped together and are referred to as the {100} set of planes.

We may also consider the planes shown in Figures 1.8b and 1.8c. The intercepts of the plane shown in Figure 1.8b are \( p = 1 \), \( q = 1 \), and \( s = \infty \). The Miller indices are found by taking the reciprocal of these intercepts and, as a result, this plane is referred to as the {110} plane. In a similar way, the plane shown in Figure 1.8c is referred to as the {111} plane.

One characteristic of a crystal that can be determined is the distance between nearest equivalent parallel planes. Another characteristic is the surface concentration of atoms, number per square centimeter (#/cm\(^2\)), that are cut by a particular plane. Again, a single-crystal semiconductor is not infinitely large and must terminate at some surface. The surface density of atoms may be important, for example, in determining how another material, such as an insulator, will “fit” on the surface of a semiconductor material.

## EXAMPLE 1.3

**Objective:** Calculate the surface density of atoms on a particular plane in a crystal.

Consider the body-centered cubic structure and the (110) plane shown in Figure 1.9a. Assume the atoms can be represented as hard spheres with the closest atoms touching each other. Assume the lattice constant is \( a_1 = 5 \) Å. Figure 1.9b shows how the atoms are cut by the (110) plane.

The atom at each corner is shared by four similar equivalent lattice planes, so each corner atom effectively contributes one-fourth of its area to this lattice plane as indicated in the figure.

The four corner atoms then effectively contribute one atom to this lattice plane. The atom in the center is completely enclosed in the lattice plane. There is no other equivalent plane that
