layer charge equal to zero, whereas a positive gate voltage will induce a larger inversion layer charge.

Figure 10.21 is a plot of the threshold voltage \(V_{TN}\) as a function of the acceptor doping concentration for various positive oxide charge values. We may note that the p-type semiconductor must be somewhat heavily doped in order to obtain an enhancement mode device.

The previous derivation of the threshold voltage assumed a p-type semiconductor for substrate. The same type of derivation can be done with an n-type semiconductor substrate, where a negative gate voltage can induce an inversion layer of holes at the oxide–semiconductor interface.

Figure 10.15 shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS structure with an n-type substrate and with an applied negative gate voltage. The threshold voltage for this case can be derived and is given by

\[
V_{TP} = \left(-|Q_{SD}(\text{max})| - Q'_{it}\right) \left(\frac{t_{\text{ox}}}{\epsilon_{\text{ox}}}\right) + \phi_{ms} - 2\phi_{f}
\]

where

\[
\phi_{ms} = \phi_m - \left(\chi' + \frac{E_g}{2e} - \phi_f\right)
\]

\[
|Q_{SD}(\text{max})| = eN_Ax_{dT}
\]

\[
x_{dT} = \left(\frac{4\epsilon_s\phi_f}{eN_A}\right)^{1/2}
