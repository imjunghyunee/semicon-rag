# REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. Why are the electron generation rate and recombination rate equal in thermal equilibrium?

2. Define the excess carrier recombination rate in terms of excess carrier concentration and lifetime.

3. Explain how the density of holes, for example, can change as a result of a change in the flux of particles.

4. Why is the general ambipolar transport equation nonlinear?

5. Explain qualitatively why a pulse of excess electrons and holes would move together in the presence of an applied electric field.

6. Explain qualitatively why the excess carrier lifetime reduces to that of the minority carrier under low injection.

7. What is the time dependence of the density of excess carriers when the generation rate becomes zero?

8. In the presence of an external force, why doesnâ€™t the density of excess carriers continue to increase with time?

9. When a concentration of one type of excess carrier is suddenly created in a semiconductor, what is the mechanism by which the net charge density quickly becomes zero?

10. State the definition of the quasi-Fermi level for electrons. Repeat for holes.

11. Explain why the presence of traps in a semiconductor increases the recombination rate of excess carriers.

12. Why, in general, is the concentration of excess carriers less at the surface of a semiconductor than in the bulk?
