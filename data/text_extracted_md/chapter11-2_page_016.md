# 11.5.2 Radiation-Induced Interface States

We have considered the effect of interface states on the Câ€“V characteristics of an MOS capacitor and on the MOSFET characteristics. The net charge in the interface states of an n-channel MOS device at the threshold inversion point is negative. This negative charge causes a shift in threshold voltage in the positive voltage direction, which is opposite to the shift due to the positive oxide charge. In addition, since the interface states can be charged, they are another source of coulomb interaction with the inversion charge carrier, which means that the inversion carrier mobility is a function of the interface state density through surface-scattering effects. Interface states, then, affect both threshold voltage and carrier mobility.

When MOS devices are exposed to ionizing radiation, additional interface states are generated at the Si-SiO\(_2\) interface. The radiation-induced interface states tend to be donor states in the lower half of the bandgap and acceptor states in the upper half. Figure 11.32 shows the threshold voltage in an n-channel and a p-channel MOSFET as a function of ionizing radiation dose. We initially see the negative threshold voltage shift in both devices due to the radiation-induced positive oxide charge. The reversal in threshold shift at the higher dose levels is attributable to the creation of radiation-induced interface states that tend to compensate the radiation-induced positive oxide charge.

In our discussion of subthreshold conduction, we have mentioned that the slope of the ln \(I_D\) versus \(V_{GS}\) curves in the subthreshold region is a function of the density of interface states. Figure 11.33 shows the subthreshold current at several total ionizing dose levels.
