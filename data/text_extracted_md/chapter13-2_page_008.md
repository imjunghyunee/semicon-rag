# 13.4 Equivalent Circuit and Frequency Limitations

In order to analyze a transistor circuit, one needs a mathematical model or equivalent circuit of the transistor. One of the most useful models is the small-signal equivalent circuit, which applies to transistors used in linear amplifier circuits. This equivalent circuit will introduce frequency effects in the transistor through the equivalent capacitorâ€“resistor circuits. The various physical factors in the JFET affecting the frequency limitations are considered here and a transistor cutoff frequency, which is a figure of merit, is then defined.

## 13.4.1 Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit

The cross section of an n-channel pn JFET is shown in Figure 13.18, including source and drain series resistances. The substrate may be semi-insulating gallium arsenide or it may be a p+ type substrate.

Figure 13.19 shows a small-signal equivalent circuit for the JFET. The voltage \( V_{g'} \) is the internal gate-to-source voltage that controls the drain current. The \( r_g \) and \( C_{gs} \) parameters are the gate-to-source diffusion resistance and junction capacitance, respectively. The gate-to-source junction is reverse biased for depletion mode devices and has only a small forward-bias voltage for enhancement mode devices, so that normally \( r_g \) is large. The parameters \( r_d \) and \( C_{gd} \) are the gate-to-drain resistance and capacitance, respectively. The resistance \( r_{ds} \) is the finite drain resistance, which is a function of the channel length modulation effect. The \( C_d \) capacitance is mainly a drain-to-source parasitic capacitance and \( C_s \) is the drain-to-substrate capacitance.

The ideal small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 13.20a. All diffusion resistances are infinite, the series resistances are zero, and at low frequency the
