## 10.2.3 Fixed Oxide and Interface Charge Effects

In all of the discussion concerning C–V characteristics so far, we have assumed an ideal oxide in which there are no fixed oxide or oxide–semiconductor interface charges. These two types of charges will change the C–V characteristics.

We previously discussed how the fixed oxide charge affects the threshold voltage. This charge will also affect the flat-band voltage. The flat-band voltage from Equation (10.25) is given by

\[
V_{FB} = \phi_{ms} - \frac{Q'_f}{C_{ox}}
\]

where \( Q'_f \) is the equivalent fixed oxide charge and \( \phi_{ms} \) is the metal–semiconductor work function difference. The flat-band voltage shifts to more negative voltages for a positive fixed oxide charge. Since the oxide charge is not a function of gate voltage, the curves
