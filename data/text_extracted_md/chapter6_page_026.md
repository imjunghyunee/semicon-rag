**Figure 6.12** (a) The idealized excess carrier pulse at terminal A at \( t = 0 \). (b) The excess carrier pulse versus time at terminal B for a given applied electric field. (c) The excess carrier pulse versus time at terminal B for a smaller applied electric field.

The semiconductor producing an output voltage as a function of time is given in Figure 6.12b. The peak of the pulse will arrive at contact B at time \( t_0 \). If the applied electric field is reduced to a value \( E_{02}, \, E_{02} < E_{01} \), the output voltage response at contact B will look approximately as shown in Figure 6.12c. For the smaller electric field, the drift velocity of the pulse of excess carriers is smaller, and so it will take a longer time for the pulse to reach the contact B. During this longer time period, there is more diffusion and more recombination. The excess carrier pulse shapes shown in Figure 6.12b, c are different for the two electric field conditions.
