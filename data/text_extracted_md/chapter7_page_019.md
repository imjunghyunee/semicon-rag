Created electrons and holes move in opposite directions due to the electric field and thereby create a reverse-biased current. In addition, the newly generated electrons and/or holes may acquire sufficient energy to ionize other atoms, leading to the avalanche process. For most pn junctions, the predominant breakdown mechanism will be the avalanche effect.

If we assume that a reverse-biased electron current \( I_{n0} \) enters the depletion region at \( x = 0 \) as shown in Figure 7.13, the electron current \( I_n \) will increase with distance through the depletion region due to the avalanche process. At \( x = W \), the electron current may be written as

\[
I_n(W) = M_n I_{n0}
\]
