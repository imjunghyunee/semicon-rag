achieve the same current value when a series resistance is included. In most diodes, the series resistance will be negligible. In some semiconductor devices with pn junctions, however, the series resistance will be in a feedback loop; in these cases, the resistance is multiplied by a gain factor and becomes non-negligible.

### TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 8.5**  
A GaAs pn junction diode at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) has the same parameters given in Ex 8.7 except that \( D_n = 207 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \) and \( D_p = 9.80 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \). Determine the diffusion resistance and diffusion capacitance if the diode is forward biased at (a) \( V_a = 0.970 \, \text{V} \) and (b) \( V_a = 1.045 \, \text{V} \).

**TYU 8.6**  
A silicon pn junction diode at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) has the same parameters as those described in Ex 8.7. The neutral n-region and neutral p-region lengths are 0.01 cm. Estimate the series resistance of the diode (neglect ohmic contacts).

## 8.4 | CHARGE STORAGE AND DIODE TRANSIENTS

The pn junction is typically used as an electrical switch. In forward bias, referred to as the on state, a relatively large current can be produced by a small applied voltage; in reverse bias, referred to as the off state, only a very small current will exist. Of primary interest in circuit applications is the speed of the pn junction diode in switching states. We qualitatively discuss the transients that occur and the charge storage effects. We simply state the equations that describe the switching times without any mathematical derivations.
