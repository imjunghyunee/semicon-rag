# 4.1 Charge Carriers in Semiconductors

**Comment**

The parameter values at any temperature can easily be found by using the 300 K values and the temperature dependence.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 4.2**  
(a) Repeat Example 4.2 at \( T = 250 \, \text{K} \).  
(b) What is the ratio of \( p_0 \) at \( T = 250 \, \text{K} \) to that at \( T = 400 \, \text{K} \)?

The effective density of states functions, \( N_c \) and \( N_v \), are constant for a given semiconductor material at a fixed temperature. Table 4.1 gives the values of the density of states function and of the density of states effective masses for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium. Note that the value of \( N_v \) for gallium arsenide is smaller than the typical \( 10^{19} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) value. This difference is due to the small electron effective mass in gallium arsenide.

The thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons in the conduction band and of holes in the valence band are directly related to the effective density of states constants and to the Fermi energy level.

## TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 4.1**  
Calculate the thermal equilibrium electron and hole concentration in silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) for the case when the Fermi energy level is 0.22 eV below the conduction-band energy \( E_c \). The value of \( E_g \) is given in Appendix B.4.

**TYU 4.2**  
Determine the thermal equilibrium electron and hole concentration in GaAs at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) for the case when the Fermi energy level is 0.30 eV above the valence-band energy \( E_v \). The value of \( E_g \) is given in Appendix B.4.

## 4.1.3 The Intrinsic Carrier Concentration

For an intrinsic semiconductor, the concentration of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the concentration of holes in the valence band. We may denote \( n_i \) and \( p_i \) as the electron and hole concentrations, respectively, in the intrinsic semiconductor. These parameters are usually referred to as the intrinsic electron concentration and intrinsic hole concentration. However, \( n_i = p_i \), so normally we simply use the parameter \( n_i \) as the intrinsic carrier concentration, which refers to either the intrinsic electron or hole concentration.
