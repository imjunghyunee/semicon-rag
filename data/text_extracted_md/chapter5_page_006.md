# 5.1 Carrier Drift

electrons to move unimpeded, or with no scattering, through the crystal. But the thermal vibrations cause a disruption of the potential function, resulting in an interaction between the electrons or holes and the vibrating lattice atoms. This lattice scattering is also referred to as **phonon scattering**.

Since lattice scattering is related to the thermal motion of atoms, the rate at which the scattering occurs is a function of temperature. If we denote \( \mu_L \) as the mobility that would be observed if only lattice scattering existed, then the scattering theory states that to first order

\[
\mu_L \propto T^{-3/2}
\]

Mobility that is due to lattice scattering increases as the temperature decreases. Intuitively, we expect the lattice vibrations to decrease as the temperature decreases, which implies that the probability of a scattering event also decreases, thus increasing mobility.

Figure 5.2 shows the temperature dependence of electron and hole mobilities in silicon. In lightly doped semiconductors, lattice scattering dominates and the carrier mobility decreases with temperature as we have discussed. The temperature dependence of mobility is proportional to \( T^{-n} \). The inserts in the figure show that the parameter \( n \) is not equal to \( \frac{3}{2} \) as the first-order scattering theory predicted. However, mobility does increase as the temperature decreases.

The second interaction mechanism affecting carrier mobility is called **ionized impurity scattering**. We have seen that impurity atoms are added to the semiconductor to control or alter its characteristics. These impurities are ionized at room temperature so that a coulomb interaction exists between the electrons or holes and the ionized impurities. This coulomb interaction produces scattering or collisions and also alters the velocity characteristics of the charge carrier. If we denote \( \mu_i \) as the mobility that would be observed if only ionized impurity scattering existed, then to first order we have

\[
\mu_i \propto \frac{T^{3/2}}{N_i}
\]

where \( N_i = N_i^+ + N_i^- \) is the total ionized impurity concentration in the semiconductor. If temperature increases, the random thermal velocity of a carrier increases, reducing the time the carrier spends in the vicinity of the ionized impurity center. The less time spent in the vicinity of a coulomb force, the smaller the scattering effect and the larger the expected value of \( \mu_i \). If the number of ionized impurity centers increases, then the probability of a carrier encountering an ionized impurity center increases, implying a smaller value of \( \mu_i \).

Figure 5.3 is a plot of electron and hole mobilities in germanium, silicon, and gallium arsenide at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) as a function of impurity concentration. More accurately, these curves are of mobility versus ionized impurity concentration \( N_i \). As the impurity concentration increases, the number of impurity scattering centers increases, thus reducing mobility.

If \( \tau_L \) is the mean time between collisions due to lattice scattering, then \( dt/\tau_L \) is the probability of a lattice scattering event occurring in a differential time \( dt \). Likewise, if \( \tau_i \) is the mean time between collisions due to ionized impurity scattering, then \( dt/\tau_i \) is the probability of an ionized impurity scattering event occurring in the differential time \( dt \).
