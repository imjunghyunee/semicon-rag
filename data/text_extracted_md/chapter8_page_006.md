### 8.1 pn Junction Current

force achieved at thermal equilibrium is upset. The electric field force that prevented majority carriers from crossing the space charge region is reduced; majority carrier electrons from the n side are now injected across the depletion region into the p material, and majority carrier holes from the p side are injected across the depletion region into the n material. As long as the bias \( V_a \) is applied, the injection of carriers across the space charge region continues and a current is created in the pn junction. This bias condition is known as forward bias; the energy-band diagram of the forward-biased pn junction is shown in Figure 8.3b.

The potential barrier \( V_0 \) in Equation (8.4) can be replaced by \( (V_0 - V_a) \) when the junction is forward biased. Equation (8.4) becomes

\[
n_p = n_{p0} \exp \left( \frac{-e(V_0 - V_a)}{kT} \right) = n_{p0} \exp \left( \frac{-eV_0}{kT} \right) \exp \left( \frac{+eV_a}{kT} \right)
\]

(8.5)

If we assume low injection, the majority carrier electron concentration \( n_{n0} \), for example, does not change significantly. However, the minority carrier concentration, \( n_p \), can deviate from its thermal-equilibrium value \( n_{p0} \) by orders of magnitude. Using Equation (8.4), we can write Equation (8.5) as

\[
n_p = n_{p0} \exp \left( \frac{eV_a}{kT} \right)
\]

(8.6)

When a forward-bias voltage is applied to the pn junction, the junction is no longer in thermal equilibrium. The left side of Equation (8.6) is the total minority carrier electron concentration in the p region, which is now greater than the thermal equilibrium value. The forward-bias voltage lowers the potential barrier so that majority carrier electrons from the n region are injected across the junction into the p region, thereby increasing the minority carrier electron concentration. We have produced excess minority carrier electrons in the p region.

When the electrons are injected into the p region, these excess carriers are subject to the diffusion and recombination processes we discussed in Chapter 6. Equation (8.6), then, is the expression for the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the space charge region in the p region.

Exactly the same process occurs for majority carrier holes in the p region, which are injected across the space charge region into the n region under a forward-bias voltage. We can write that

\[
p_n = p_{n0} \exp \left( \frac{eV_a}{kT} \right)
\]

(8.7)

where \( p_n \) is the concentration of minority carrier holes at the edge of the space charge region in the n region. Figure 8.4 shows these results. By applying a forward-bias voltage, we create excess minority carriers in each region of the pn junction.
