are mostly filled with electrons and the energy states above \( E_F \) are mostly empty. In the degenerate n-type semiconductor, the states between \( E_F \) and \( E_c \) are mostly filled with electrons; thus, the electron concentration in the conduction band is very large. Similarly, in the degenerate p-type semiconductor, the energy states between \( E_v \) and \( E_F \) are mostly empty; thus, the hole concentration in the valence band is very large.

## 4.4.1 Statistics of Donors and Acceptors

In the previous chapter, we discussed the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, which gives the probability that a particular energy state will be occupied by an electron. We need to reconsider this function and apply the probability statistics to the donor and acceptor energy states.

### 4.4.1 Probability Function

One postulate used in the derivation of the Fermi–Dirac probability function was the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that only one particle is permitted in each quantum state. The Pauli exclusion principle also applies to the donor and acceptor states.

Suppose we have \( N_d \) electrons and \( g_i \) quantum states, where the subscript \( i \) indicates the \( i \)th energy level. There are \( g_i \) ways of choosing where to put the first particle. Each donor level has two possible spin orientations for the donor electron; thus, each donor level has two quantum states. The insertion of an electron into one quantum state, however, precludes putting an electron into the second quantum state. By adding one electron, the vacancy requirement of the atom is satisfied, and the addition of a second electron in the donor level is not possible. The distribution function of donor electrons in the donor energy states is then slightly different than the Fermi–Dirac function.

The probability function of electrons occupying the donor state is

\[
n_d = \frac{N_d}{1 + \frac{1}{2} \exp \left( \frac{E_d - E_F}{kT} \right)}
\]
