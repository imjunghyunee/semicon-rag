where \( \mu_n \) is the mobility of the electrons in the inversion layer and \(|Q_I|\) is the magnitude of the inversion layer charge per unit area. The inversion layer charge is a function of the gate voltage; thus, the basic MOS transistor action is the modulation of the channel conductance by the gate voltage. The channel conductance, in turn, determines the drain current. We will initially assume that the mobility is a constant; we will discuss mobility effects and variations in the next chapter.

The \( I_D \) versus \( V_{DS} \) characteristics, for small values of \( V_{DS} \), are shown in Figure 10.38. When \( V_{GS} < V_T \), the drain current is zero. As \( V_{GS} \) becomes larger than \( V_T \), channel inversion charge density increases, which increases the channel conductance. A larger value of \( g_d \) produces a larger initial slope of the \( I_D \) versus \( V_{DS} \) characteristic as shown in the figure.

Figure 10.39a shows the basic MOS structure for the case when \( V_{GS} > V_T \) and the applied \( V_{DS} \) voltage is small. The thickness of the inversion channel layer in the
