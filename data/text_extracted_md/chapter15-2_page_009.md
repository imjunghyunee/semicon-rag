## Text

Would be due to breakdown triggering. The two terminals alternately share the role of anode and cathode during successive half cycles of the AC voltage.

Triggering by a gate control is more complex for this device since a single gate region must serve for both of the antiparallel thyristors. One such device is known as a triac. Figure 15.38a shows the cross section of such a device. This device can be triggered into conduction by gate signals of either polarity and with anode-to-cathode voltages of either polarity.
