Mean time between collisions or the mean distance between scattering events. In the long-channel device, the channel length \( L \) is much longer than the mean distance between collisions \( l \), so that an average carrier drift velocity exists. As the MOSFET channel length is reduced, the mean distance between collisions \( l \) may become comparable to \( L \) so that the previous analysis may not be valid. If the channel length is further reduced so that \( L < l \), then a large fraction of carriers could travel from the source to the drain without experiencing a scattering event. This motion of carriers is called **ballistic transport**.

Ballistic transport means that carriers travel faster than the average drift velocity or the saturation velocity, and this effect can lead to very fast devices. Ballistic transport occurs in submicron (\( L < 1 \, \mu m \)) devices. As the MOSFET technology continues to shrink the channel length toward the 0.1 \(\mu m\) value, the ballistic transport phenomenon will become more important.
