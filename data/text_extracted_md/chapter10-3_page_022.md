# CHAPTER 10 Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

**process conduction parameter**  
The product of carrier mobility and oxide capacitance.

**saturation**  
The condition in which the inversion charge density is zero at the drain and the drain current is no longer a function of the drain-to-source voltage.

**strong inversion**  
The condition in which the inversion charge density is larger than the magnitude of the semiconductor doping concentration.

**threshold inversion point**  
The condition in which the inversion charge density is equal in magnitude to the semiconductor doping concentration.

**threshold voltage**  
The gate voltage that must be applied to achieve the threshold inversion point.

**transconductance**  
The ratio of an incremental change in drain current to the corresponding incremental change in gate voltage.

**weak inversion**  
The condition in which the inversion charge density is less than the magnitude of the semiconductor doping concentration.
