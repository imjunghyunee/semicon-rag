**Figure 6.16** | The four basic trapping and emission processes for the case of an acceptor-type trap.

- **Process 1**: Electron capture
- **Process 2**: Electron emission
- **Process 3**: Hole capture
- **Process 4**: Hole emission

The Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination assumes that a single recombination center, or trap, exists at an energy \( E_t \) within the bandgap. There are four basic processes, shown in Figure 6.16, that may occur at this single trap. We will assume that the trap is an acceptor-type trap; that is, it is negatively charged when it contains an electron and is neutral when it does not contain an electron.

The four basic processes are as follows:

- **Process 1**: The capture of an electron from the conduction band by an initially neutral empty trap.
- **Process 2**: The inverse of process 1—the emission of an electron that is initially occupying a trap level back into the conduction band.
- **Process 3**: The capture of a hole from the valence band by a trap containing an electron. (Or we may consider the process to be the emission of an electron from the trap into the valence band.)
- **Process 4**: The inverse of process 3—the emission of a hole from a neutral trap into the valence band. (Or we may consider this process to be the capture of an electron from the valence band.)

In process 1, the rate at which electrons from the conduction band are captured by the traps is proportional to the density of electrons in the conduction band and...
