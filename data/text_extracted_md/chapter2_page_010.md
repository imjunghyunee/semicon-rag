**Figure 2.5** Potential functions and corresponding wave function solutions for the case (a) when the potential function is finite everywhere and (b) when the potential function is infinite in some regions.

Since \(|\psi(x)|^2\) is a probability density, then \(\psi(x)\) must be finite and single-valued. If the probability density were to become infinite at some point in space, then the probability of finding the particle at this position would be certain and the uncertainty principle would be violated. If the total energy \(E\) and the potential \(V(x)\) are finite everywhere, then from Equation (2.13), the second derivative must be finite, which implies that the first derivative must be continuous. The first derivative is related to the particle momentum, which must be finite and single-valued. Finally, a finite first derivative implies that the function itself must be continuous. In some of the specific examples that we will consider, the potential function will become infinite in particular regions of space. For these cases, the first derivative will not necessarily be continuous, but the remaining boundary conditions will still hold.

Figure 2.5 shows two possible examples of potential functions and the corresponding wave solutions. In Figure 2.5a, the potential function is finite everywhere. The wave function as well as its first derivative is continuous. In Figure 2.5b, the potential function is infinite for \(x < 0\) and for \(x > a\). The wave function is continuous at the boundaries, but the first derivative is discontinuous. We will actually determine the wave functions in the following sections and in end-of-chapter problems.

## 2.3 APPLICATIONS OF SCHRODINGER’S WAVE EQUATION

We will now apply Schrodinger’s wave equation in several examples using various potential functions. These examples will demonstrate the techniques used in the solution of Schrodinger’s differential equation and the results of these examples will provide an indication of the electron behavior under these various potentials.
