# Chapter 8: The pn Junction Diode

- Excess carriers are generated in the space charge region of a reverse-biased pn junction. These carriers are swept out by the electric field and create the reverse-biased generation current that is another component of the reverse-biased diode current. Excess carriers recombine in the space charge region of a forward-biased pn junction. This recombination process creates the forward-bias recombination current that is another component of the forward-bias diode current.

- The small-signal equivalent circuit of the pn junction diode was developed. The two parameters of interest are the diffusion resistance and the diffusion capacitance.

- When a pn junction is switched from forward bias to reverse bias, the stored excess minority carrier charge must be removed from the junction. The time required to remove this charge is called the storage time and is a limiting factor in the switching speed of a diode.

- The I–V characteristics of a tunnel diode were developed showing a region of negative differential resistance.

## Glossary of Important Terms

**carrier injection**  
The flow of carriers across the space charge region of a pn junction when a voltage is applied.

**diffusion capacitance**  
The capacitance of a forward-biased pn junction due to minority carrier storage effects.

**diffusion conductance**  
The ratio of a low-frequency, small-signal sinusoidal current to voltage in a forward-biased pn junction.

**diffusion resistance**  
The inverse of diffusion conductance.

**forward bias**  
The condition in which a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region of a pn junction so that the potential barrier between the two regions is lowered below the thermal-equilibrium value.

**generation current**  
The reverse-biased pn junction current produced by the thermal generation of electron–hole pairs within the space charge region.

**high-level injection**  
The condition in which the excess carrier concentration becomes comparable to or greater than the majority carrier concentration.

**“long” diode**  
A pn junction diode in which both the neutral p and n regions are long compared with the respective minority carrier diffusion lengths.

**recombination current**  
The forward-bias pn junction current produced as a result of the flow of electrons and holes that recombine within the space charge region.

**reverse saturation current**

**storage time**  
The time required for the excess minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge to go from their steady-state values to zero when the diode is switched from forward to reverse bias.
