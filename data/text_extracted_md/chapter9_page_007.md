**Figure 9.3** | \(1/C^2\) versus \(V_R\) for W–Si and W–GaAs Schottky barrier diodes.  
(From Sze and Ng [115].)

### Comment

The experimental value of 0.52 V can be compared with the ideal barrier height of \(\phi_{B0} = 0.54\) V found in Example 9.1. These results agree fairly well. For other metals, the discrepancy between experiment and theory is larger.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 9.2** Repeat Example 9.2 for the GaAs diode capacitance data shown in Figure 9.3.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{(c. } W) & : 0.01 \times 2.9 = N \times 1.9 \times 0 = N \times 1.9 \times 1.9 \times 10^{15} \text{ cm}^{-3}
\end{align*}
\]

We can see that the built-in potential barrier of the gallium arsenide Schottky diode is larger than that of the silicon diode. This experimental result is normally observed for all types of metal contacts.

### TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 9.1** Consider an ideal chromium-to-n-type silicon Schottky diode at \(T = 300\) K. Assume the semiconductor is doped at a concentration of \(N_D = 3 \times 10^{15}\) cm\(^{-3}\). Determine the (a) ideal Schottky barrier height, (b) built-in potential barrier, (c) peak electric field with an applied reverse-biased voltage of \(V_R = 5\) V, and (d) junction capacitance per unit area for \(V_R = 5\) V.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{(a) } & \phi_{B0} = 0.01 \times 8.69 = \ldots \\
\text{(b) } & \phi_{B0} = \ldots \\
\text{(c) } & \text{Peak electric field} = \ldots \\
\text{(d) } & \text{Junction capacitance} = \ldots
\end{align*}
\]
