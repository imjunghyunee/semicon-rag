### Figure 11.16

!Figure 11.16
- **Description**: Threshold voltage versus channel length for various substrate dopings.
- **Parameters**: 
  - \( t_{\text{ox}} = 50 \, \text{nm} \)
  - \( t_j = 0.5 \, \mu\text{m} \)
  - \( V_{GB} = 5 \, \text{V} \)
  - \( N_a = 10^{15}, 10^{16}, 5 \times 10^{16}, 10^{17} \)

### Figure 11.17

!Figure 11.17
- **Description**: Threshold voltage versus channel length for two values of drain-to-source and body-to-source voltage.
- **Parameters**: 
  - \( V_{DS} = 0.125 \, \text{V}, 4 \, \text{V} \)
  - \( V_{BS} = 0 \, \text{V}, 1.25 \, \text{V} \)

plotted in Figure 11.17 for two values of drain-to-source voltage and two values of body-to-source voltage.

### 11.3.2 Narrow-Channel Effects

Figure 11.18 shows the cross section along the channel width of an n-channel MOSFET biased at inversion. The current is perpendicular to the channel width through the inversion charge. We may note in the figure that there is an additional space charge region at each end of the channel width. This additional charge is controlled by the gate voltage but is not included in the derivation of the ideal threshold voltage relation. The threshold voltage expression must be modified to include this additional charge.
