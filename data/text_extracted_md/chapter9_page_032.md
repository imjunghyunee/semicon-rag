We may consider the general characteristics of the energy-band diagrams of the other types of heterojunction. Figure 9.23 shows the energy-band diagram of an Np heterojunction. The same \(\Delta E_c\) and \(\Delta E_v\) discontinuities exist, although the general shape of the conduction band, for example, is different in the nP and the Np junctions. This difference in energy bands will influence the \(I–V\) characteristics of the two junctions.

The other two types of heterojunctions are the nN and the pP isotype junctions. The energy-band diagram of the nN junction is shown in Figure 9.19. To achieve thermal equilibrium, electrons from the wide-bandgap material will flow into the narrow-bandgap material. A positive space charge region exists in the wide-bandgap material and an accumulation layer of electrons now exists at the interface in the narrow-bandgap material. Since there are a large number of allowed energy states in the conduction band, we expect the space charge width \(x_n\) and the built-in potential barrier \(V_{bi}\) to be small in the narrow-gap material. The energy-band diagram of the pP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 9.24. To achieve thermal equilibrium, holes from the wide-bandgap material will flow into the narrow-bandgap material, creating an accumulation layer of holes in the narrow-bandgap material at the interface. These types of isotype heterojunctions are obviously not possible in a homojunction.
