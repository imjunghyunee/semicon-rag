# PROBLEMS

(Note: In the following problems, assume the semiconductor and oxide in the MOS system are silicon and silicon dioxide, respectively, and assume the temperature is \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) unless otherwise stated. Use Figure 10.16 to determine the metal–semiconductor work function difference.)
