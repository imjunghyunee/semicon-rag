## 4.2 DOPANT ATOMS AND ENERGY LEVELS

The intrinsic semiconductor may be an interesting material, but the real power of semiconductors is realized by adding small, controlled amounts of specific dopant, or impurity, atoms. This doping process, described briefly in Chapter 1, can greatly alter the electrical characteristics of the semiconductor. The doped semiconductor, called an extrinsic material, is the primary reason we can fabricate the various semiconductor devices that we will consider in later chapters.

### 4.2.1 Qualitative Description

In Chapter 3, we discussed the covalent bonding of silicon and considered the simple two-dimensional representation of the single-crystal silicon lattice as shown in Figure 4.3. Now consider adding a group V element, such as phosphorus, as a substitutional impurity. The group V element has five valence electrons. Four of these will contribute to the covalent bonding with the silicon atoms, leaving the fifth more loosely bound to the phosphorus atom. This effect is schematically shown in Figure 4.4. We refer to the fifth valence electron as a donor electron.

The phosphorus atom without the donor electron is positively charged. At very low temperatures, the donor electron is bound to the phosphorus atom. However, by intuition, it should seem clear that the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band is considerably less than that for the electrons involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 4.5 shows the energy-band diagram that we would expect. The energy level, \( E_D \), is the energy state of the donor electron.
