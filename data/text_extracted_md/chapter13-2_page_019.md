It seems clear that HEMTs are inherently superior to other FET technologies in terms of achieving higher speeds of operation, lower power dissipation, and lower noise. These advantages derive directly from the superior transport properties obtained by using undoped GaAs as the channel layer for the FET. One way to achieve an adequate carrier concentration in an undoped channel is to accumulate the carriers at a semiconductor heterojunction interface, as we have seen. The disadvantage of the HEMT is that the fabrication processes for the heterojunction are more complicated.

## 13.6 | SUMMARY

- The physics, characteristics, and operation of the junction field-effect transistor are considered in this chapter.
- The current in a JFET is controlled by an electric field applied perpendicular to the direction of current. The current is in the channel region between the source and drain contacts. In a pn JFET, the channel forms one side of a pn junction that is used to modulate the channel conductance.
- Two primary parameters of the JFET are the internal pinchoff voltage \( V_0 \) and the pinchoff voltage \( V_p \). The internal pinchoff voltage is defined as a positive quantity and is the total gate-to-channel potential that causes the junction space charge layer to completely fill the channel region. The pinchoff voltage is defined as the gate voltage that must be applied to achieve the pinchoff condition.
- The ideal current–voltage relationship is derived. The transconductance, or transistor gain, is the rate of change of drain current with respect to the corresponding change in gate-to-source voltage.
- Three nonideal effects are considered; channel-length modulation, velocity saturation, and subthreshold current. Each of these effects changes the ideal current–voltage relationship.
- A small-signal equivalent circuit of the JFET is developed. The equivalent circuit includes capacitances that introduce frequency effects in the transistor. Two physical factors affect the frequency limitation; channel transit time and capacitance charging time. The capacitance charging time constant is normally the limiting factor in short channel devices.
- The high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure utilizes a heterojunction. A two-dimensional electron gas is confined to a potential well at the heterojunction interface. However, the electrons are free to move parallel to the interface. These electrons are separated from the ionized donors so that ionized impurity scattering effects are minimized, resulting in a high mobility.

**capacitance charging time**  
The time associated with charging or discharging the input gate capacitance with a change in the input gate signal.

**channel conductance**  
The ratio of a differential change in drain current to the corresponding differential change in drain-to-source voltage in the limit as the drain-to-source voltage approaches zero.

**channel conductance modulation**  
The process whereby the channel conductance changes with gate voltage; this is the basic field-effect transistor action.
