## 11.1 Nonideal Effects

As with any semiconductor device, the experimental characteristics of MOSFETs deviate to some degree from the ideal relations that have been theoretically derived using the various assumptions and approximations. In this section, we consider five effects that cause deviations from the assumptions used in the ideal derivations. These effects are subthreshold conduction, channel length modulation, mobility variations, velocity saturation, and ballistic transport.

### 11.1.1 Subthreshold Conduction

The ideal current–voltage relationship predicts zero drain current when the gate-to-source voltage is less than or equal to the threshold voltage. Experimentally, \( I_D \) is not zero when \( V_{GS} \leq V_T \). Figure 11.1 shows a comparison between the ideal characteristic that was derived, and the experimental results. The drain current, which exists for \( V_{GS} \leq V_T \), is known as the **subthreshold current**.

Figure 11.2 shows the energy-band diagram of an MOS structure with a p-type substrate biased so that \( \phi_s < 2\phi_B \). At the same time, the Fermi level is closer to the conduction band than the valence band, so the semiconductor surface develops the
