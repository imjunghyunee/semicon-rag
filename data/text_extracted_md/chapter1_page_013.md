The interaction of atoms tends to form closed valence shells such as we see in ionic bonding. Another atomic bond that tends to achieve closed-valence energy shells is **covalent bonding**, an example of which is found in the hydrogen molecule. A hydrogen atom has one electron and needs one more electron to complete the lowest energy shell. A schematic of two noninteracting hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen molecule with the covalent bonding, is shown in Figure 1.16. Covalent bonding results in electrons being shared between atoms, so that in effect the valence energy shell of each atom is full.

Atoms in group IV of the periodic table, such as silicon and germanium, also tend to form covalent bonds. Each of these elements has four valence electrons and needs four more electrons to complete the valence energy shell. If a silicon atom, for example, has four nearest neighbors, with each neighbor atom contributing one valence electron to be shared, then the center atom will in effect have eight electrons in its outer shell. Figure 1.17a schematically shows five noninteracting silicon atoms with the four valence electrons around each atom. A two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in silicon is shown in Figure 1.17b. The center atom has eight shared valence electrons.

A significant difference between the covalent bonding of hydrogen and of silicon is that, when the hydrogen molecule is formed, it has no additional electrons to form additional covalent bonds, while the outer silicon atoms always have valence electrons available for additional covalent bonding. The silicon array may then be formed into an infinite crystal, with each silicon atom having four nearest neighbors and eight shared electrons. The four nearest neighbors in silicon forming the covalent bond correspond to the tetrahedral structure and the diamond lattice, which were shown in Figures 1.12 and 1.11 respectively. Atomic bonding and crystal structure are obviously directly related.

The third major atomic bonding scheme is referred to as **metallic bonding**. Group I elements have one valence electron. If two sodium atoms (\(Z = 11\)), for example, are brought into close proximity, the valence electrons interact in a way similar to that in covalent bonding. When a third sodium atom is brought into close proximity with the
