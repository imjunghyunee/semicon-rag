# 14.6.1 Stimulated Emission and Population Inversion

Figure 14.31a shows the case when an incident photon is absorbed and an electron is elevated from an energy state \( E_1 \) to an energy state \( E_2 \). This process is known as induced absorption. If the electron spontaneously makes the transition back to the lower energy level with a photon being emitted, we have a spontaneous emission process as indicated in Figure 14.31b. On the other hand, if there is an incident photon at a time when an electron is in the higher energy state as shown in Figure 14.31c, the incident photon can interact with the electron, causing the electron to make a transition downward. The downward transition produces a photon. Since this process was initiated by the incident photon, the process is called **stimulated or induced emission**. Note that this stimulated emission process has produced two photons; thus, we can have optical gain or amplification. The two emitted photons are in phase so that the spectral output will be coherent.

In thermal equilibrium, the electron distribution in a semiconductor is determined by the Fermiâ€“Dirac statistics. If the Boltzmann approximation applies, then we can write

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp \left[ -\frac{(E_2 - E_1)}{kT} \right]
\]

(14.62)

where \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) are the electron concentrations in the energy levels \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), respectively, and where \( E_2 > E_1 \). In thermal equilibrium, \( N_2 < N_1 \). The probability of an induced absorption event is exactly the same as that of an induced emission event. The number of photons absorbed is proportional to \( N_1 \) and the number of additional photons emitted is proportional to \( N_2 \). In order to achieve optical amplification or for lasing action to occur, we must have \( N_2 > N_1 \); this is called population inversion. We cannot achieve lasing action at thermal equilibrium.
