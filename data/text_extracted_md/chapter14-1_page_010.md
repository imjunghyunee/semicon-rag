## 14.2.2 Conversion Efficiency and Solar Concentration

The conversion efficiency of a solar cell is defined as the ratio of output electrical power to incident optical power. For the maximum power output, we can write

\[
\eta = \frac{P_m}{P_{in}} \times 100\% = \frac{I_m V_m}{P_{in}} \times 100\%
\]

(14.14)

The maximum possible current and the maximum possible voltage in the solar cell are \(I_{sc}\) and \(V_{oc}\) respectively. The ratio \(I_m V_m / I_{sc} V_{oc}\) is called the fill factor and is a measure of the realizable power from a solar cell. Typically, the fill factor is between 0.7 and 0.8.

The conventional pn junction solar cell has a single semiconductor bandgap energy. When the cell is exposed to the solar spectrum, a photon with energy less than \(E_g\) will have no effect on the electrical output power of the solar cell. A photon with energy greater than \(E_g\) will contribute to the solar cell output power, but the fraction of photon energy that is greater than \(E_g\) will eventually only be dissipated as heat. Figure 14.9 shows the solar spectral irradiance (power per unit area per unit wavelength) where air mass zero represents the solar spectrum outside the earth’s atmosphere and air mass one is the solar spectrum at the earth’s surface at noon. The maximum efficiency of a silicon pn junction solar cell is approximately 28 percent. Nonideal factors, such as series resistance and reflection from the semiconductor surface, will lower the conversion efficiency typically to the range of 10 to 15 percent.

A large optical lens can be used to concentrate sunlight onto a solar cell so that the light intensity can be increased up to several hundred times. The short-circuit current increases linearly with light concentration while the open-circuit voltage increases only slightly with concentration. Figure 14.10 shows the ideal solar cell efficiency at 300 K for two values of solar concentration. We can see that the conversion efficiency increases only slightly with optical concentration. The primary advantage of using concentration techniques is to reduce the overall system cost since an optical lens is less expensive than an equivalent area of solar cells.
