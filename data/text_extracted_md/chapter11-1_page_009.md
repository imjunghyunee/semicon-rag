The relationship between the inversion charge mobility and the transverse electric field is usually measured experimentally. An effective transverse electric field can be defined as

\[
E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_s} \left( |Q_{D} \, (\text{max})| + \frac{1}{2} |Q_{I}| \right)
\]

(11.14)

The effective inversion charge mobility can be determined from the channel conductance as a function of gate voltage. Figure 11.10 shows the effective electron mobility at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) for different doping levels and different oxide thicknesses. The effective mobility is only a function of the electric field at the inversion layer and is independent of oxide thickness. The effective mobility may be represented by

\[
\mu_{\text{eff}} = \mu_0 \left( \frac{E_{\text{eff}}}{E_0} \right)^{-1/3}
\]

(11.15)

where \( \mu_0 \) and \( E_0 \) are constants determined from experimental results.
