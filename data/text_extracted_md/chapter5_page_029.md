# REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. Write the equation for the total drift current density. Is the linear relationship between drift current density and electric field always valid? Why or why not.
2. Define electron and hole mobility. What is the unit of mobility?
3. Explain the temperature dependence of mobility. Why is the carrier mobility a function of the ionized impurity concentrations?
4. Define conductivity. Define resistivity. What are the units of conductivity and resistivity?
5. Sketch the drift velocity of electrons in silicon versus electric field. Repeat for GaAs.

## Section 5.1 Carrier Drift

**5.1**  
The concentration of donor impurity atoms in silicon is \( N_D = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Assume an electron mobility of \( \mu_n = 1300 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{s} \) and a hole mobility of \( \mu_p = 450 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{s} \).

(a) Calculate the resistivity of the material.  
(b) What is the conductivity of the material?

**5.2**  
A p-type silicon material is to have a conductivity of \( \sigma = 1.80 \, (\Omega\cdot\text{cm})^{-1} \). If the mobility values are \( \mu_n = 1250 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{s} \) and \( \mu_p = 380 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{s} \), what must be the acceptor impurity concentration in the material?
