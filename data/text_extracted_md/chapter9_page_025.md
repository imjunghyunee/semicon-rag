### 9.3 Heterojunctions

There are four basic types of heterojunction. Those in which the dopant type changes at the junction are called anisotype. We can form nP or Np junctions, where the capital letter indicates the larger-bandgap material. Heterojunctions with the same dopant type on either side of the junction are called isotype. We can form nN and pP isotype heterojunctions.

Figure 9.17 shows the energy-band diagrams of isolated n-type and p-type materials, with the vacuum level used as a reference. The electron affinity of the wide-bandgap material is less than that of the narrow-bandgap material. The difference between the two conduction band energies is denoted by \(\Delta E_c\), and the difference between the two valence band energies is denoted by \(\Delta E_v\). From Figure 9.17, we can see that

\[
\Delta E_c = e(\chi_n - \chi_p)
\]

(9.34a)

and

\[
\Delta E_c + \Delta E_v = E_{g,p} - E_{g,n} = \Delta E_g
\]

(9.34b)

In the ideal abrupt heterojunction using nondegenerately doped semiconductors, the vacuum level is parallel to both conduction bands and valence bands. If the vacuum level is continuous, then the same \(\Delta E_c\) and \(\Delta E_v\) discontinuities will exist at the junction.
