Figure 10.2b shows a MOS capacitor with a p-type semiconductor substrate. The top metal gate is at a negative voltage with respect to the semiconductor substrate. From the example of the parallel-plate capacitor, we can see that a negative charge will exist on the top metal plate and an electric field will be induced with the direction shown in the figure. If the electric field were to penetrate into the semiconductor, the majority carrier holes would experience a force toward the oxide–semiconductor interface. Figure 10.2c shows the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this particular applied voltage. An **accumulation layer** of holes at the oxide–semiconductor junction corresponds to the positive charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor.

Figure 10.3a shows the same MOS capacitor in which the polarity of the applied voltage is reversed. A positive charge now exists on the top metal plate and the induced electric field is in the opposite direction as shown. If the electric field penetrates the semiconductor in this case, majority carrier holes will experience a force away from the oxide–semiconductor interface. As the holes are pushed away from
