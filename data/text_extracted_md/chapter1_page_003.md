to those of a nonsingle-crystal material, since grain boundaries tend to degrade the electrical characteristics. Two-dimensional representations of amorphous, polycrystalline, and single-crystal materials are shown in Figure 1.1.

## 1.3.1 Space Lattices

Our primary emphasis in this text will be on the single-crystal material with its regular geometric periodicity in the atomic arrangement. **A representative unit, or a group of atoms, is repeated at regular intervals in each of the three dimensions to form the single crystal. The periodic arrangement of atoms in the crystal is called the lattice.**

### 1.3.1.1 Primitive and Unit Cell

We can represent a particular atomic array by a dot that is called a **lattice point**. Figure 1.2 shows an infinite two-dimensional array of lattice points. The simplest means of repeating an atomic array is by translation. **Each lattice point in Figure 1.2 can be translated a distance \(a_1\) in one direction and a distance \(b_1\) in a second noncollinear direction to generate the two-dimensional lattice.** A third noncollinear translation will produce the three-dimensional lattice. **The translation directions need not be perpendicular.**

Since the three-dimensional lattice is a periodic repetition of a group of atoms, we do not need to consider the entire lattice, but only a fundamental unit that is being repeated. **A unit cell is a small volume of the crystal that can be used to reproduce the entire crystal.** A unit cell is not a unique entity. **Figure 1.3 shows several possible unit cells in a two-dimensional lattice.**

The unit cell A can be translated in directions \(a_2\) and \(b_2\), the unit cell B can be translated in directions \(a_3\) and \(b_3\), and the entire two-dimensional lattice can be constructed by the translations of either of these unit cells. The unit cells C and D in Figure 1.3 can also be used to construct the entire lattice by using the appropriate translations. This discussion of two-dimensional unit cells can easily be extended to three dimensions to describe a real single-crystal material.
