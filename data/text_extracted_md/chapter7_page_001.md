## The pn Junction

Up to this point in the text, we have been considering the properties of the semiconductor material. We calculated electron and hole concentrations in thermal equilibrium and determined the position of the Fermi level. We then considered the nonequilibrium condition in which excess electrons and holes are present in the semiconductor. We now wish to consider the situation in which a p-type and an n-type semiconductor are brought into contact with one another to form a pn junction.

Most semiconductor devices contain at least one junction between p-type and n-type semiconductor regions. Semiconductor device characteristics and operation are intimately connected to these pn junctions, so considerable attention is devoted initially to this basic device.

The electrostatics of the zero-biased and reverse-biased pn junction is considered in this chapter. The current–voltage characteristics of the pn junction diode are developed in the next chapter.

In this chapter, we will:

- Consider a uniformly doped pn junction, in which one region of the semiconductor is uniformly doped with acceptor atoms and the adjacent region is uniformly doped with donor atoms.
- Determine the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium.
- Discuss the creation of a space charge region between the p and n regions.
- Apply Poisson’s equation to determine the electric field in the space charge region and calculate the built-in potential barrier.
- Analyze the changes that occur in the pn junction when a reverse-biased voltage is applied. Derive expressions for space charge width and depletion capacitance.
- Analyze the voltage breakdown characteristics of a pn junction.
- Consider the properties of a nonuniformly doped pn junction. Specific doping profiles can lead to desirable properties of the pn junction.
