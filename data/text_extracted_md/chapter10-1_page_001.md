## Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

The single-junction semiconductor devices that we have considered, including the pn homojunction diode, can be used to produce rectifying current–voltage characteristics and to form electronic switching circuits. The transistor is a multijunction semiconductor device that, in conjunction with other circuit elements, is capable of current gain, voltage gain, and signal power gain. The basic transistor action is the control of current at one terminal by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the device.

The Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is one of two major types of transistors. The fundamental physics of the MOSFET is developed in this chapter. The MOSFET is used extensively in digital circuit applications where, because of its small size, millions of devices can be fabricated in a single integrated circuit.

Two complementary configurations of MOS transistors, the n-channel MOSFET and the p-channel MOSFET, can be fabricated. Electronic circuit design becomes very versatile when the two types of devices are used in the same circuit. These circuits are referred to as complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits.

## 10.0 | PREVIEW

In this chapter, we will:

- Study the characteristics of energy bands as a function of applied voltage in the metal–oxide–semiconductor structure known as the MOS capacitor. The MOS capacitor is the heart of the MOSFET.
- Discuss the concept of surface inversion in the semiconductor of the MOS capacitor.
