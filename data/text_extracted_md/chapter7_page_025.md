# 7.5 Nonuniformly Doped Junctions

**Figure 7.18** Differential change in space charge width with a differential change in reverse-biased voltage for a linearly graded pn junction.

\( dQ' \), which is uncovered as a differential voltage \( dV_R \) is applied. The junction capacitance is then

\[
C' = \frac{dQ'}{dV_R} = (ea\alpha) \frac{dx_0}{dV_R}
\]

(7.72)

Using Equation (7.71), we obtain\(^1\)

\[
C' = \left\{ \frac{ea\epsilon^2}{12(V_{bi} + V_R)} \right\}^{1/3}
\]

(7.73)

We may note that \( C' \) is proportional to \( (V_{bi} + V_R)^{-1/3} \) for the linearly graded junction as compared to \( C' \propto (V_{bi} + V_R)^{-1/2} \) for the uniformly doped junction. In the linearly graded junction, the capacitance is less dependent on reverse-biased voltage than in the uniformly doped junction.

## 7.5.2 Hyperabrupt Junctions

The uniformly doped junction and linearly graded junction are not the only possible doping profiles. Figure 7.19 shows a generalized one-sided p\(^+\)n junction where the generalized n-type doping concentration for \( x > 0 \) is given by

\[
N = Bx^m
\]

(7.74)

The case of \( m = 0 \) corresponds to the uniformly doped junction, and \( m = +1 \) corresponds to the linearly graded junction just discussed. The cases of \( m = +2 \) and \( m = +3 \) would approximate a fairly low-doped epitaxial n-type layer grown

\(^1\)In a more exact analysis, \( V_R \) in Equation (7.73) is replaced by a gradient voltage. However, this analysis is beyond the scope of this text.
