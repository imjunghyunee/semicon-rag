!Graph of excess hole concentration versus distance at various times for zero applied electric field.

**Figure 6.8** Excess hole concentration versus distance at various times for zero applied electric field.

- \( \delta p(x, t) \)
- \( t = t_1 > 0 \)
- \( t = t_2 > t_1 \)
- \( t = t_3 > t_2 \)
- \( E = 0 \)
- \( x = 0 \)
- Distance, \( x \)
