**Figure 4.17** | Position of Fermi level for an (a) n-type \((N_D > N_A)\) and (b) p-type \((N_A > N_D)\) semiconductor.

We may again note from Equation (4.65) that, for an n-type semiconductor, \(n_0 > p_0\) and \(E_F > E_Fi\). The Fermi level for an n-type semiconductor is above \(E_Fi\). For a p-type semiconductor, \(p_0 > n_0\), and from Equation (4.68) we see that \(E_Fi > E_F\). The Fermi level for a p-type semiconductor is below \(E_Fi\). These results are shown in Figure 4.17.

## 4.6.2 Variation of \(E_F\) with Doping Concentration and Temperature

We may plot the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping concentration. **Figure 4.18** shows the Fermi energy level as a function of donor concentration (n-type) and as a function of acceptor concentration (p-type) for silicon at \(T = 300 \, K\). As the doping levels increase, the Fermi energy level moves closer to the conduction band for the n-type material and closer to the valence band for the p-type material. Keep in mind that the equations for the Fermi energy level that we have derived assume that the Boltzmann approximation is valid.

- **n-type**: Fermi level moves closer to \(E_c\).
- **p-type**: Fermi level moves closer to \(E_v\).
