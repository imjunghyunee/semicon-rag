An important point to note from the devices shown in Figure 12.2 is that the bipolar transistor is not a symmetrical device. Although the transistor may contain two n regions or two p regions, the impurity doping concentrations in the emitter and collector are different and the geometry of these regions can be vastly different. The block diagrams of Figure 12.1 are highly simplified, but useful, concepts in the development of the basic transistor theory.

## 12.1.1 The Basic Principle of Operation

The npn and pnp transistors are complementary devices. We develop the bipolar transistor theory using the npn transistor, but the same basic principles and equations also apply to the pnp device. Figure 12.3 shows an idealized impurity doping profile in an npn bipolar transistor for the case when each region is uniformly doped. Typical impurity doping concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector may be on the order of \(10^{19}\), \(10^{17}\), and \(10^{15}\) cm\(^{-3}\), respectively.

The base–emitter (B–E) pn junction is forward biased and the base–collector (B–C) pn junction is reverse biased in the normal bias configuration as shown in Figure 12.3.
