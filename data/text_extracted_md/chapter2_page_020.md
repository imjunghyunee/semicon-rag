# 2.3.4 The Potential Barrier and Tunneling

We now want to consider the potential barrier function, which is shown in Figure 2.9. The more interesting problem, again, is in the case when the total energy of an incident particle is \( E < V_0 \). Again assume that we have a flux of incident particles originating on the negative x-axis traveling in the \( +x \) direction. As before, we need to solve SchrÃ¶dinger's time-independent wave equation in each of the three regions. The solutions of the wave equation in regions I, II, and III are given, respectively, as

\[
\psi_1(x) = A_1 e^{jk_1x} + B_1 e^{-jk_1x} \tag{2.60a}
\]

\[
\psi_2(x) = A_2 e^{k_2x} + B_2 e^{-k_2x} \tag{2.60b}
\]

\[
\psi_3(x) = A_3 e^{jk_1x} + B_3 e^{-jk_1x} \tag{2.60c}
\]

where

\[
k_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \tag{2.61a}
\]

and

\[
k_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (V_0 - E)} \tag{2.61b}
\]

The coefficient \( B_3 \) in Equation (2.60c) represents a negative traveling wave in region III. However, once a particle gets into region III, there are no potential changes to cause a reflection; therefore, the coefficient \( B_3 \) must be zero. We must keep both exponential terms in Equation (2.60b) since the potential barrier width is finite; that is, neither term will become unbounded. We have four boundary relations for the boundaries at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = a \) corresponding to the wave function and its first derivative being continuous. We can solve for the four coefficients \( B_1, A_2, B_2, \) and \( A_3 \) in terms of \( A_1 \). The wave solutions in the three regions are shown in Figure 2.10.
