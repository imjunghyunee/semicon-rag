# 9.3 HETEROJUNCTIONS

In the discussion of pn junctions in the previous chapters, we assumed that the semiconductor material is homogeneous throughout the structure. This type of junction is called a **homojunction**. When two different semiconductor materials are used to form a junction, the junction is called a **semiconductor heterojunction**.

As with many topics in this text, our goal is to provide the basic concepts concerning the heterojunction. The complete analysis of heterojunction structures involves quantum mechanics and detailed calculations that are beyond the scope of this text. The discussion of heterojunctions will, then, be limited to the introduction of some basic concepts.

## 9.3.1 Heterojunction Materials

Since the two materials used to form a heterojunction will have different energy bandgaps, the energy band will have a discontinuity at the junction interface. We may have an abrupt junction in which the semiconductor changes abruptly from a narrow-bandgap material to a wide-bandgap material. On the other hand, if we have a GaAs–Al\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)As system, for example, the value of \(x\) may continuously vary over a distance of several nanometers to form a graded heterojunction. Changing the value of \(x\) in the Al\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)As system allows us to engineer, or design, the bandgap energy.

In order to have a useful heterojunction, the lattice constants of the two materials must be well matched. The lattice match is important because any lattice mismatch can introduce dislocations resulting in interface states. For example, germanium and gallium arsenide have lattice constants matched to within approximately 0.13 percent. Germanium–gallium arsenide heterojunctions have been studied quite extensively. More recently, gallium arsenide–aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs–AlGaAs) junctions have been investigated quite thoroughly, since the lattice constants of GaAs and the AlGaAs system vary by no more than 0.14 percent.

## 9.3.2 Energy-Band Diagrams

In the formation of a heterojunction with a narrow-bandgap material and a wide-bandgap material, the alignment of the bandgap energies is important in determining the characteristics of the junction. Figure 9.16 shows three possible situations. In Figure 9.16a, we see the case when the forbidden bandgap of the wide-gap material completely overlaps the bandgap of the narrow-gap material. This case, called **straddling**, applies to most heterojunctions. We consider only this case here. The other possibilities are called **staggered** and **broken gap** and are shown in Figure 9.16b,c.
