# 9.3 Heterojunctions

!Ideal energy-band diagram of an nN heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.

**Figure 9.19** Ideal energy-band diagram of an nN heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.

The diagram refers to the condition in which the electrons have quantized energy levels in one spatial direction (perpendicular to the interface), but are free to move in the other two spatial directions.

The potential function near the interface can be approximated by a triangular potential well. Figure 9.20a shows the conduction band edges near the abrupt junction interface and Figure 9.20b shows the approximation of the triangular potential well. We can write:

\[
V(z) = eEz \quad z > 0 \tag{9.35a}
\]

\[
V(z) = \infty \quad z < 0 \tag{9.35b}
\]

Schrodingerâ€™s wave equation can be solved using this potential function. The quantized energy levels are shown in Figure 9.20b. Higher energy levels are usually not considered.
