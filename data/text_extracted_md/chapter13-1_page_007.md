When a slightly forward-bias voltage is applied, the depletion region just extends through the channel—a condition known as **threshold**, shown in Figure 13.8b. The threshold voltage is the gate-to-source voltage that must be applied to create the pinch-off condition. The threshold voltage for this n-channel MESFET is positive, in contrast to the negative voltage for the n-channel depletion mode device. If a larger forward bias is applied, the channel region opens as shown in Figure 13.8c.
