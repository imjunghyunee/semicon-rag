# Glossary of Important Terms

**alpha cutoff frequency**  
The frequency at which the magnitude of the common-base current is \(1/\sqrt{2}\) of its low-frequency value; also equal to the cutoff frequency.

**bandgap narrowing**  
The reduction in the forbidden energy bandgap with high emitter doping concentration.

**base transit time**  
The time that it takes a minority carrier to cross the neutral base region.

**base transport factor**  
The factor in the common-base current gain that accounts for recombination in the neutral base width.

**base width modulation**  
The change in the neutral base width with C–E or C–B voltage.

**beta cutoff frequency**  
The frequency at which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain is \(1/\sqrt{2}\) of its low-frequency value.

**collector capacitance charging time**  
The time constant that describes the time required for the B–C and collector–substrate space charge widths to change with a change in emitter current.

**collector depletion region transit time**  
The time that it takes a carrier to be swept across the B–C space charge region.

**common-base current gain**  
The ratio of collector current to emitter current.

**common-emitter current gain**  
The ratio of collector current to base current.

**current crowding**  
The nonuniform current density across the emitter junction area created by a lateral voltage drop in the base region due to a finite base current and base resistance.

**cutoff**  
The bias condition in which zero- or reverse-biased voltages are applied to both transistor junctions, resulting in zero transistor currents.

**cutoff frequency**  
The frequency at which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain is unity.

**early effect**  
Another term for base width modulation.

**early voltage**  
The value of voltage (magnitude) at the intercept on the voltage axis obtained by extrapolating the IC versus VCE curves to zero current.

**emitter–base junction capacitance charging time**  
The time constant describing the time for the B–E space charge width to change with a change in emitter current.

**emitter injection efficiency factor**  
The factor in the common-base current gain that takes into account the injection of carriers from the base into the emitter.

**forward active**  
The bias condition in which the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C junction is reverse biased.

**inverse active**  
The bias condition in which the B–E junction is reverse biased and the B–C junction is forward biased.

**output conductance**  
The ratio of a differential change in collector current to the corresponding differential change in C–E voltage.
