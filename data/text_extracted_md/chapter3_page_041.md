# Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

The actual Boltzmann approximation is valid when \(\exp[(E - E_F)/kT] \gg 1\). However, it is still common practice to use the \(E - E_F \gg kT\) notation when applying the Boltzmann approximation. We will use this Boltzmann approximation in our discussion of semiconductors in the next chapter.

## 3.6 | SUMMARY

- Discrete allowed electron energies split into a band of allowed energies as atoms are brought together to form a crystal.
- The concept of allowed and forbidden energy bands was developed more rigorously by considering quantum mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave equation using the Kronig–Penney model representing the potential function of a single-crystal material. This result forms the basis of the energy-band theory of semiconductors.
- The concept of effective mass was developed. Effective mass relates the motion of a particle in a crystal to an externally applied force and takes into account the effect of the crystal lattice on the motion of the particle.
- Two charged particles exist in a semiconductor. An electron is a negatively charged particle with a positive effective mass existing at the bottom of an allowed energy band. A hole is a positively charged particle with a positive effective mass existing at the top of an allowed energy band.
- The \(E\) versus \(k\) diagrams of silicon and gallium arsenide were given and the concept of direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors was discussed.
- Energies within an allowed energy band are actually at discrete levels and each contains a finite number of quantum states. The density per unit energy of quantum states was determined by using the three-dimensional infinite potential well as a model.
- In dealing with large numbers of electrons and holes, we must consider the statistical behavior of these particles. The Fermi–Dirac probability function was developed, which gives the probability of a quantum state at an energy \(E\) of being occupied by an electron. The Fermi energy was defined.
