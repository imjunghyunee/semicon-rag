**Figure 6.15** (a) Thermal-equilibrium energy-band diagram for \( N_A = 10^5 \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( n_i = 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). (b) Quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes if \( 10^{13} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) excess carriers are present.

The quasi-Fermi energy level for the minority carrier holes is significantly different from the Fermi level and illustrates the fact that we have deviated from thermal equilibrium significantly. Since the electron concentration has increased, the quasi-Fermi level for electrons has moved slightly closer to the conduction band. The hole concentration has increased significantly so that the quasi-Fermi level for holes has moved much closer to the valence band. We will consider the quasi-Fermi energy levels again when we discuss forward-biased pn junctions.

## 6.5 EXCESS CARRIER LIFETIME

The rate at which excess electrons and holes recombine is an important characteristic of the semiconductor and influences many of the device characteristics, as we will see in later chapters. We considered recombination briefly at the beginning of this chapter and argued that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the mean carrier lifetime. We have assumed up to this point that the mean carrier lifetime is simply a parameter of the semiconductor material.

We have been considering an ideal semiconductor in which electronic energy states do not exist within the forbidden-energy bandgap. This ideal effect is present in a perfect single-crystal material with an ideal periodic-potential function. In a real semiconductor material, defects occur within the crystal and disrupt the perfect periodic-potential function. If the density of these defects is not too great, the defects will create discrete electronic energy states within the forbidden-energy band. These allowed energy states may be the dominant effect in determining the mean carrier lifetime. The mean carrier lifetime may be determined from the Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination.

### 6.5.1 Shockley–Read–Hall Theory of Recombination

An allowed energy state, also called a trap, within the forbidden bandgap may act as a recombination center, capturing both electrons and holes with almost equal probability. This equal probability of capture means that the capture cross sections for
