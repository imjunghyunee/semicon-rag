is shown in Figure 10.6b. A positive space charge region is induced in the n-type semiconductor in this situation.

The energy-band diagrams for this MOS capacitor with the n-type substrate are shown in Figure 10.7. Figure 10.7a shows the case when a positive voltage is applied to the gate and an accumulation layer of electrons is formed. Figure 10.7b shows the energy bands when a negative voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction and valence bands now bend upward indicating that a space charge region has been induced in the n-type substrate. Figure 10.7c shows the energy bands when a larger negative voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction and valence bands are bent even more and the intrinsic Fermi level has moved above the Fermi level. The valence band at the surface is now close to the Fermi level, whereas the conduction band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor. This result implies that the semiconductor surface adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is p type. By applying a sufficiently large negative voltage to the gate of the MOS capacitor, the semiconductor surface has been inverted from n type to p type. An inversion layer of holes has been induced at the oxide–semiconductor interface.

## 10.1.2 Depletion Layer Thickness

We may calculate the width of the induced space charge region adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. Figure 10.8 shows the space charge region in a p-type semiconductor substrate. The potential \( \phi_p \) is the difference (in V) between \( E_{Fi} \) and \( E_F \) and is given by

\[
\phi_p = V_t \ln \left( \frac{N_a}{n_i} \right)
\]

(10.4)

where \( N_a \) is the acceptor doping concentration and \( n_i \) is the intrinsic carrier concentration.

The potential \( \phi_s \) is called the surface potential; it is the difference (in V) between \( E_{Fi} \) measured in the bulk semiconductor and \( E_{Fi} \) measured at the surface. The surface
