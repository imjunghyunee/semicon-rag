# CHAPTER 14 Optical Devices

## EXAMPLE 14.7

**Objective:** Determine the output wavelength of a GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) material for two different mole fractions.

Consider first GaAs and then GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\).

**Solution**  
GaAs has a bandgap energy of \( E_g = 1.42 \, \text{eV} \). This material would produce a photon output at a wavelength of

\[
\lambda = \frac{1.24}{E} = \frac{1.24}{1.42} = 0.873 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

This wavelength is in the infrared range and not in the visible range. If we desire a visible output with a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.653 \, \mu\text{m} \), for example, the bandgap energy would have to be

\[
E = \frac{1.24}{\lambda} = \frac{1.24}{0.653} = 1.90 \, \text{eV}
\]

This bandgap energy would correspond to a mole fraction of approximately \( x = 0.4 \).

**Comment**  
By changing the mole fraction in the GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) system, the output can change from the infrared to the red spectrum.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**  
Ex 14.7 Determine the output wavelength of a GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) material for mole fractions of  
(a) \( x = 0.15 \) and (b) \( x = 0.30 \).

## 14.5 LIGHT EMITTING DIODES

Photodetectors and solar cells convert optical energy into electrical energyâ€”the photons generate excess electrons and holes, which produce an electric current. We might also apply a voltage across a pn junction resulting in a diode current, which in turn can produce photons and a light output. This inverse mechanism is called injection electroluminescence. This device is known as a Light Emitting Diode (LED). The spectral output of an LED may have a relatively wide wavelength bandwidth of between 30 and 40 nm. However, this emission spectrum is narrow enough so that a particular color is observed, provided the output is in the visible range.

### 14.5.1 Generation of Light

As we have discussed previously, photons may be emitted if an electron and hole recombine by a direct band-to-band recombination process in a direct bandgap material. The emission wavelength, from Equation (14.1), is

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_g} = \frac{1.24}{E_g} \, \mu\text{m} \quad (14.53)
\]

where \( E_g \) is the bandgap energy measured in electron-volts.
