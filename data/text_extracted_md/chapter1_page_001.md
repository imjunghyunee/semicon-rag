## The Crystal Structure of Solids

This text deals with the electrical properties and characteristics of semiconductors for materials and devices. The electrical properties of solids are therefore of primary interest. The semiconductor is in general a single-crystal material. The electrical properties of a single-crystal material are determined not only by the chemical composition but also by the arrangement of atoms in the solid; this being true, a brief study of the crystal structure of solids is warranted. The formation, or growth, of the single-crystal material is an important part of semiconductor technology. A short discussion of several growth techniques is included in this chapter to provide the reader with some of the terminology that describes semiconductor device structures.

### 1.0 | PREVIEW

In this chapter, we will:

- Describe three classifications of solidsâ€”amorphous, polycrystalline, and single crystal.
- Discuss the concept of a unit cell.
- Describe three simple crystal structures and determine the volume and surface density of atoms in each structure.
- Describe the diamond crystal structure.
- Briefly discuss several methods of forming single-crystal semiconductor materials.

### 1.1 | SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS

Semiconductors are a group of materials having conductivities between those of metals and insulators. Two general classifications of semiconductors are the elemental semiconductor materials, found in group IV of the periodic table, and the compound semiconductor materials, most of which are formed from special combinations of group III and group V elements. Table 1.1 shows a portion of the periodic table in
