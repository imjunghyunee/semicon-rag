### 10.1 The Two-Terminal MOS Structure

!Figure 10.16

**Figure 10.16** Metal–semiconductor work function difference versus doping for aluminum, gold, and n\(^+\) and p\(^+\) polysilicon gates.

where \(\phi_{ms}\) is assumed to be a positive value. We will have similar expressions for n\(^+\) and p\(^+\) polysilicon gates.

Figure 10.16 shows the work function differences as a function of semiconductor doping for the various types of gates. We may note that the magnitudes of \(\phi_{ms}\) for the polysilicon gates are somewhat larger than Equations (10.16) and (10.17) predict. This difference again is because the Fermi level is not equal to the conduction-band energy for the n\(^+\) gate and is not equal to the valence-band energy for the p\(^+\) gate. The metal–semiconductor work function difference becomes important in the flat-band and threshold voltage parameters discussed next.

#### 10.1.5 Flat-Band Voltage

The **flat-band voltage** is defined as the applied gate voltage such that there is no band bending in the semiconductor and, as a result, zero net space charge in this region. Figure 10.17 shows this flat-band condition. Because of the work function difference and possible trapped charge in the oxide, the voltage across the oxide for this case is not necessarily zero.

We have implicitly been assuming that there is zero net charge density in the oxide material. This assumption may not be valid—a net fixed charge density,
