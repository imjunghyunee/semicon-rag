## 2.1 Principles of Quantum Mechanics

In discrete packets or bundles, the particle-like packet of energy is called a **photon**, whose energy is also given by \( E = h\nu \). A photon with sufficient energy, then, can knock an electron from the surface of the material. The minimum energy required to remove an electron is called the **work function** of the material and any excess photon energy goes into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. This result was confirmed experimentally as demonstrated in Figure 2.1. The photoelectric effect shows the discrete nature of the photon and demonstrates the particle-like behavior of the photon.

The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron can be written as

\[
T = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 = h\nu - \Phi = h\nu - h\nu_0 \quad (\nu \geq \nu_0)
\]

\[
\Phi = h\nu_0
\]

where \( h\nu \) is the incident photon energy and \( \Phi = h\nu_0 \) is the minimum energy, or work function, required to remove an electron from the surface.

### Objective

Calculate the photon energy corresponding to a particular wavelength.

**Example 2.1**

Consider an x-ray with a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.708 \times 10^{-8} \) cm.

#### Solution

The energy is

\[
E = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.625 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^{10})}{0.708 \times 10^{-8}} = 2.81 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}
\]

This value of energy may be given in the more common unit of electron-volt (see Appendix D). We have

\[
E = \frac{2.81 \times 10^{-15}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.75 \times 10^4 \, \text{eV}
\]

#### Comment

The reciprocal relation between photon energy and wavelength is demonstrated: A large energy corresponds to a short wavelength.

#### Exercise Problem

**Ex 2.1** Determine the energy (in eV) of a photon having a wavelength of (a) \( \lambda = 100 \, \text{Å} \) and (b) \( \lambda = 4500 \, \text{Å} \).

### 2.1.2 Wave–Particle Duality

We have seen in the last section that light waves, in the photoelectric effect, behave as if they are particles. The particle-like behavior of electromagnetic waves was also instrumental in the explanation of the **Compton effect**. In this experiment, an x-ray beam was incident on a solid. A portion of the x-ray beam was deflected and the frequency of the deflected wave had shifted compared with the incident wave. The observed change in frequency and the deflected angle corresponded exactly to the expected results of a "billiard ball" collision between an x-ray quanta, or photon, and an electron in which both energy and momentum are conserved.
