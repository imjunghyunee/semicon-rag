# 6.4 Quasi-Fermi Energy Levels

The Haynesâ€“Shockley experiment is elegant in the sense that the three basic processes of drift, diffusion, and recombination are all observed in a single experiment. The determination of mobility is straightforward and can yield accurate values. The determination of the diffusion coefficient and lifetime is more complicated and may lead to some inaccuracies.

## 6.4.1 Quasi-Fermi Energy Levels

The thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are functions of the Fermi energy level. We can write

\[
n_0 = n_i \exp \left( \frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \right) \tag{6.84a}
\]

and

\[
p_0 = n_i \exp \left( \frac{E_{Fi} - E_F}{kT} \right) \tag{6.84b}
\]

where \( E_F \) and \( E_{Fi} \) are the Fermi energy and intrinsic Fermi energy, respectively, and \( n_i \) is the intrinsic carrier concentration. Figure 6.14a shows the energy-band diagram for an n-type semiconductor in which \( E_F > E_{Fi} \). For this case, we may note from Equations (6.84a) and (6.84b) that \( n_0 > n_i \) and \( p_0 < n_i \), as we would expect. Similarly, Figure 6.14b shows the energy-band diagram for a p-type semiconductor in which \( E_F < E_{Fi} \). Again we may note from Equations (6.84a) and (6.84b) that \( n_0 < n_i \) and \( p_0 > n_i \), as we would expect for the p-type material. These results are for thermal equilibrium.

If excess carriers are created in a semiconductor, we are no longer in thermal equilibrium and the Fermi energy is strictly no longer defined. However, we may define a quasi-Fermi level for electrons and a quasi-Fermi level for holes that apply for nonequilibrium. If \( \delta n \) and \( \delta p \) are the excess electron and hole concentrations, respectively, we may write

\[
n_0 + \delta n = n_i \exp \left( \frac{E_n - E_{Fi}}{kT} \right) \tag{6.85a}
\]
