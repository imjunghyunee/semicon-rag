(a) with zero gate bias and (b) with a negative gate bias.

Sufficiently large negative voltage is applied to the gate. Figure 13.28 shows the energy-band diagrams of the metal–AlGaAs–GaAs structure under zero bias and with a reverse bias applied to the gate. With zero bias, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is below the Fermi level, implying a large density of the two-dimensional electron gas. With a negative voltage applied to the gate, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is above the Fermi level, implying that the density of the two-dimensional electron gas is very small and the current in an FET would be essentially zero.

The Schottky barrier depletes the AlGaAs layer from the surface, and the heterojunction depletes the AlGaAs layer from the heterojunction interface. Ideally the device should be designed so that the two depletion regions just overlap to prevent electron conduction through the AlGaAs layer. For depletion mode devices, the depletion layer from the Schottky gate should extend only to the heterojunction depletion layer. For enhancement mode devices, the thickness of the doped AlGaAs layer is smaller and the Schottky gate built-in potential barrier will completely...
