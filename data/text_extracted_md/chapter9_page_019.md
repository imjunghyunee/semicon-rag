# 9.2 METAL–SEMICONDUCTOR OHMIC CONTACTS

Contacts must be made between any semiconductor device, or integrated circuit, and the outside world. These contacts are made via **ohmic contacts**. Ohmic contacts are metal-to-semiconductor contacts, but in this case they are not rectifying contacts. An ohmic contact is a low-resistance junction providing conduction in both directions between the metal and the semiconductor. Ideally, the current through the ohmic contact is a linear function of applied voltage, and the applied voltage should be very small. Two general types of ohmic contacts are possible: The first type is the ideal nonrectifying barrier, and the second is the tunneling barrier. We define in this section a specific contact resistance that is used to characterize ohmic contacts.

## 9.2.1 Ideal Nonrectifying Barrier

We have considered an ideal metal-n-type semiconductor contact in Figure 9.1 for the case when \(\phi_m > \phi_s\). Figure 9.11 shows the same ideal contact for the opposite case of \(\phi_m < \phi_s\). In Figure 9.11a we see the energy levels before contact, and in Figure 9.11b, the barrier after contact for thermal equilibrium. To achieve thermal equilibrium in this junction, electrons flow from the metal into the lower energy states in the semiconductor, which makes the surface of the semiconductor more n type. The excess electron charge in the n-type semiconductor exists essentially as a surface charge density. If a positive voltage is applied to the metal, there is no barrier to electrons flowing from the semiconductor into the metal. If a positive voltage is applied to the semiconductor, the effective barrier height for electrons flowing from the metal into the semiconductor will be approximately \(\phi_{bn} = \phi_{bn}\), which is fairly small for a moderately to heavily doped semiconductor. For this bias condition, electrons can easily flow from the metal into the semiconductor.

Figure 9.12a shows the energy-band diagram when a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to the semiconductor. Electrons can easily flow “downhill”
