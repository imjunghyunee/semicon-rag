**Figure 3.18** (a) Valence band with conventional electron-filled states and empty states. (b) Concept of positive charges occupying the original empty states.

The net drift current density generated from a completely full band, then, is zero, or

\[
-e \sum_{i \, (occ)} v_i = 0
\]

(3.51)

We can now write the drift current density from Equation (3.50) for an almost full band as

\[
J = +e \sum_{i \, (empty)} v_i
\]

(3.52)

where the \( v_i \) in the summation is the

\[
v(E) = \left( \frac{1}{\hbar} \right) \frac{dE}{dk}
\]

associated with the empty state. Equation (3.52) is entirely equivalent to placing a positively charged particle in the empty states and assuming all other states in the band are empty, or neutrally charged. This concept is shown in Figure 3.18. Figure 3.18a shows the valence band with the conventional electron-filled states and empty states, whereas Figure 3.18b shows the new concept of positive charges occupying the original empty states. This concept is consistent with the discussion of the positively charged "empty state" in the valence band, as shown in Figure 3.17.

The \( v_i \) in the summation of Equation (3.52) is related to how well this positively charged particle moves in the semiconductor. Now consider an electron near the top of the allowed energy band shown in Figure 3.16b. The energy near the top of the allowed energy band may again be approximated by a parabola so that we may write

\[
(E - E_s) = -C(k)^2
\]

(3.53)

The energy \( E_s \) is the energy at the top of the energy band. Since \( E < E_s \) for electrons in this band, the parameter \( C \) must be a positive quantity.

Taking the second derivative of \( E \) with respect to \( k \) from Equation (3.53), we obtain

\[
\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = -2C
\]

(3.54)

We may rearrange this equation so that

\[
\frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \frac{-2C}{\hbar^2}
\]
