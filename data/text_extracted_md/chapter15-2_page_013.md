# CHAPTER 15: Semiconductor Microwave and Power Devices

- The "on resistance" of a MOSFET has a positive temperature coefficient so that the power MOSFET is more stable versus temperature than a power BJT. This characteristic allows MOSFETs to be fabricated in parallel to increase the current capability of the device.
- The thyristor refers to a general class of pnpn switching devices that can be switched between a high-impedance, low-current state and a low-impedance, high-current state. These devices exhibit a bistable regenerative positive feedback switching characteristic.
- The basic pnpn device can be modeled as coupled npn and pnp bipolar transistors. In the "on" state, both bipolar transistors are driven into saturation, creating the high-current, low-voltage condition. In the "off" or blocking state, large voltages can be applied to the device and the current is essentially zero.
- The turn-on characteristics of the thyristor can be controlled through a gate control terminal. The three-terminal thyristors are referred to as semiconductor controlled rectifiers (SCRs).
