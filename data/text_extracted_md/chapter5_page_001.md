## Carrier Transport Phenomena

In the previous chapter, we considered the semiconductor in equilibrium and determined electron and hole concentrations in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. A knowledge of the densities of these charged particles is important toward an understanding of the electrical properties of a semiconductor material. The net flow of the electrons and holes in a semiconductor will generate currents. The process by which these charged particles move is called **transport**. In this chapter we consider two basic transport mechanisms in a semiconductor crystal: **drift**—the movement of charge due to electric fields, and **diffusion**—the flow of charge due to density gradients.

The carrier transport phenomena are the foundation for finally determining the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. We will implicitly assume in this chapter that, although there will be a net flow of electrons and holes due to the transport processes, thermal equilibrium will not be substantially disturbed. Nonequilibrium processes are considered in the next chapter.
