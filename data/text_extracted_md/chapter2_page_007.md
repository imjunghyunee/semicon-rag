probability density function that will allow us to determine the probability that an electron has a particular energy. So in describing electron behavior, we will be dealing with probability functions.

## 2.2.1 SCHRODINGER’S WAVE EQUATION

The various experimental results involving electromagnetic waves and particles, which could not be explained by classical laws of physics, showed that a revised formulation of mechanics was required. Schrödinger, in 1926, provided a formulation called wave mechanics, which incorporated the principles of quanta introduced by Planck, and the wave–particle duality principle introduced by de Broglie. On the basis of wave–particle duality principle, we will describe the motion of electrons in a crystal by wave theory. This wave theory is described by Schrödinger’s wave equation.

### 2.2.1 The Wave Equation

The one-dimensional, nonrelativistic Schrödinger’s wave equation is given by

\[
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\Psi(x, t) = j\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t}
\]

(2.6)

where \(\Psi(x, t)\) is the wave function, \(V(x)\) is the potential function assumed to be independent of time, \(m\) is the mass of the particle, and \(j\) is the imaginary constant \(\sqrt{-1}\). There are theoretical arguments that justify the form of Schrödinger’s wave equation, but the equation is a basic postulate of quantum mechanics. The wave function \(\Psi(x, t)\) will be used to describe the behavior of the system and, mathematically, \(\Psi(x, t)\) can be a complex quantity.

We may determine the time-dependent portion of the wave function and the position-dependent, or time-independent, portion of the wave function by using the technique of separation of variables. Assume that the wave function can be written in the form

\[
\Psi(x, t) = \psi(x)\phi(t)
\]
