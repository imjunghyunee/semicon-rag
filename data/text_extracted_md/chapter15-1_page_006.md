The oscillation mechanism just described is called the transit-time mode. More complex modes of operation are possible. Studies have shown that the efficiency of the transit-time device is largest when the product \( n_0 L \) is a few times \( 10^{12} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \). For this case, the domain fills about one-half of the drift region length and produces a current output that is nearly sinusoidal. The maximum dc-to-rf conversion efficiency is approximately 10 percent.

Oscillations in the frequency range of 1 to 100 GHz or higher can be obtained. If the device is operated in a pulsed mode, a peak output power in the range of hundreds of watts can be produced. Transferred-electron devices are now used as the microwave source in many radar systems.

## 15.3 IMPATT DIODE

The term IMPATT stands for **IM**pact ionization **A**valanche **T**ransit-**T**ime. The IMPATT diode consists of a high-field avalanche region and a drift region that produces a dynamic negative resistance at microwave frequencies. The negative resistance characteristic produced in this device is a result of a time delay so that the ac current and voltage components are out of phase, and is a different phenomenon compared to the tunnel diode, for example. The tunnel diode has a negative \( dI/dV \) region in the \( I-V \) characteristic.

One example of an IMPATT diode is a \( p^+ \)-\( n^- \)-\( i \)-\( n^+ \) structure as shown in Figure 15.8a. Typical doping concentrations (magnitudes) are shown in Figure 15.8b. The device is reverse biased so that the \( n \) and intrinsic regions are completely depleted. The electric field in the device is shown in Figure 15.8c. We may note that

\[
E \, dt = V_B
\]

where \( V_B \) is the applied reverse-biased voltage. The value of \( V_B \) is very close to the breakdown voltage. The avalanche region is localized near the pn junction. The electric field in the intrinsic region is nearly constant and the intrinsic layer provides the drift region.
