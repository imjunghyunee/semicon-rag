## Objective

Calculate the reflection coefficient at a semiconductor–air interface. Consider the interface between a GaAs semiconductor and air.

### Solution

The index of refraction for GaAs is \( n_2 = 3.8 \) at a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.70 \, \mu m \) and the index of refraction for air is \( n_1 = 1.0 \). The reflection coefficient is

\[
\Gamma = \left( \frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 + n_1} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{3.8 - 1.0}{3.8 + 1.0} \right)^2 = 0.34
\]

### Comment

A reflection coefficient of \( \Gamma = 0.34 \) means that 34 percent of the photons incident from the gallium arsenide onto the semiconductor–air interface are reflected back into the semiconductor.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 14.8**  
At a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.70 \, \mu m \), the index of refraction for GaAs is \( n_2 = 3.8 \) and that for GaP is \( n_2 = 3.2 \). Consider a GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) material with a mole fraction \( x = 0.40 \). Assuming the index of refraction is a linear function of the mole fraction, determine the reflection coefficient, \( \Gamma \), at the GaAs\(_{0.6}\)P\(_{0.4}\)–air interface.  
(\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1 \, \text{J}\))

Photons incident on the semiconductor–air interface at an angle are refracted as shown in Figure 14.27. If the photons are incident on the interface at an angle greater than the critical angle \( \theta_c \), the photons experience total internal reflection. The critical angle is determined from Snell’s law and is given by

\[
\theta_c = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \right)
\]
