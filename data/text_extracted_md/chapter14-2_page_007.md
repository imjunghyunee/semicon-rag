# CHAPTER 14 Optical Devices

When excess electrons and holes are created by photon absorption, photon emission from the recombination process is called photoluminescence.

Electroluminescence is the process of generating photon emission when the excitation of excess carriers is a result of an electric current caused by an applied electric field. We are mainly concerned here with injection electroluminescence, the result of injecting carriers across a pn junction. The light emitting diode and the pn junction laser diode are examples of this phenomenon. In these devices, electric energy, in the form of a current, is converted directly into photon energy.

## 14.4.1 Basic Transitions

Once electron-hole pairs are formed, there are several possible processes by which the electrons and holes can recombine. Some recombination processes may result in photon emission from direct bandgap materials, whereas other recombination processes in the same material may not.

Figure 14.21a shows the basic interband transitions. Curve (i) corresponds to an intrinsic emission very close to the bandgap energy of the material. Curves (ii) and (iii) correspond to energetic electrons or holes. If either of these recombinations result in the emission of a photon, the energy of the emitted photon will be slightly larger than the bandgap energy. There will then be an emission spectrum and a bandwidth associated with the emission.

The possible recombination processes involving impurity or defect states are shown in Figure 14.21b. Curve (i) is the conduction band to acceptor transition, curve (ii) is the donor to valence-band transition, curve (iii) is the donor to acceptor transition, and curve (iv) is the recombination due to a deep trap. Curve (iv) is a nonradiative process corresponding to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination process discussed in Chapter 6. The other recombination processes may or may not result in the emission of a photon.

Figure 14.21c shows the Auger recombination process, which can become important in direct bandgap materials with high doping concentrations. The Auger recombination process is a nonradiative process. The Auger recombination, in one case, shown in curve (i), is a recombination between an electron and hole, accompanied by the transfer of energy to another free hole. Similarly, in the second case, the recombination between an electron and hole can result in the transfer of energy to a free electron as shown in curve (ii). The third particle involved in this process will eventually lose its energy to the lattice in the form of heat. The process involving two holes and an electron would occur predominantly in heavily doped p-type materials, and the process involving two electrons and a hole would occur primarily in a heavily doped n-type material.

The recombination processes shown in Figure 14.21a indicate that the emission of a photon is not necessarily at a single, discrete energy, but can occur over a range of energies. The spontaneous emission rate generally has the form

\[
I(\nu) \propto \nu^2 (h\nu - E_g)^{1/2} \exp \left( -\frac{(h\nu - E_g)}{kT} \right)
\]

where \( E_g \) is the bandgap energy. Figure 14.22 shows the emission spectra from gallium arsenide. The peak photon energy decreases with temperature because the...
