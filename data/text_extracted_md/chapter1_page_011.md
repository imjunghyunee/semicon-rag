!Figure 1.13  
**Figure 1.13** Portions of the diamond lattice: (a) bottom half and (b) top half.

There are several ways to visualize the diamond structure. One way to gain a further understanding of the diamond lattice is by considering Figure 1.13. Figure 1.13a shows two body-centered cubic, or tetrahedral, structures diagonally adjacent to each other. The open circles represent atoms in the lattice that are generated when the structure is translated to the right or left, one lattice constant, \(a\). Figure 1.13b represents the top half of the diamond structure. The top half again consists of two tetrahedral structures joined diagonally, but which are at 90° with respect to the bottom-half diagonal. 

An important characteristic of the diamond lattice is that any atom within the diamond structure will have four nearest neighboring atoms. We will note this characteristic again in our discussion of atomic bonding in the next section.

The diamond structure refers to the particular lattice in which all atoms are of the same species, such as silicon or germanium. The zincblende (sphalerite) structure differs from the diamond structure only in that there are two different types of atoms in the lattice. Compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, have the zincblende structure shown in Figure 1.14. The important feature of both the diamond and the zincblende structures is that the atoms are joined together to form a tetrahedron. Figure 1.15 shows the basic tetrahedral structure of GaAs in which each Ga atom has four nearest As neighbors and each As atom has four nearest Ga neighbors. This figure also begins to show the interpenetration of two sublattices that can be used to generate the diamond or zincblende lattice.
