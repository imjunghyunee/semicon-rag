- Apply the ambipolar transport equation to various situations to determine the time behavior and spatial behavior of excess carriers.
- Define the quasi-Fermi energy level.
- Analyze the effect of defects in a semiconductor on the excess carrier lifetime.
- Analyze the effect of defects at a semiconductor surface on the excess carrier concentration.

## 6.1.1 Carrier Generation and Recombination

In this chapter, we discuss carrier generation and recombination, which we can define as follows: **generation** is the process whereby electrons and holes are created, and **recombination** is the process whereby electrons and holes are annihilated.

Any deviation from thermal equilibrium will tend to change the electron and hole concentrations in a semiconductor. A sudden increase in temperature, for example, will increase the rate at which electrons and holes are thermally generated so that their concentrations will change with time until new equilibrium values are reached. An external excitation, such as light (a flux of photons), can also generate electrons and holes, creating a nonequilibrium condition. To understand the generation and recombination processes, we first consider direct band-to-band generation and recombination, and then, later, the effect of allowed electronic energy states within the bandgap, referred to as traps or recombination centers.

### 6.1.1 The Semiconductor in Equilibrium

We have determined the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. In thermal equilibrium, these concentrations are independent of time. However, electrons are continually being thermally excited from the valence band into the conduction band by the random nature of the thermal process. At the same time, electrons moving randomly through the crystal in the conduction band may come in close proximity to holes and “fall” into the empty states in the valence band. This recombination process annihilates both the electron and hole. Since the net carrier concentrations are independent of time in thermal equilibrium, the rate at which electrons and holes are generated and the rate at which they recombine must be equal. The generation and recombination processes are schematically shown in Figure 6.1.
