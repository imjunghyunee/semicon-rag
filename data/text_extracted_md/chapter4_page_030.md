For 90 percent ionization,

\[
\frac{p_x}{p_0 + p_x} = 0.10 = \frac{1}{1 + \left(1.04 \times 10^{19}\right) \left(\frac{T}{300}\right)^{3/2} \cdot \frac{1}{4 \times 10^{14}} \cdot \exp\left(\frac{-0.045}{0.0259 \left(\frac{T}{300}\right)}\right)}
\]

Using trial and error, we find that \( T = 193 \, \text{K} \).

**Comment**

This example shows that at approximately 100Â°C below room temperature, we still have 90 percent of the acceptor atoms ionized; in other words, 90 percent of the acceptor atoms have "donated" a hole to the valence band.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**

\[ [x-01 \times 9E L 8 (q) \div -01 \times 16 6 (p) \, \text{suV}] \]

## 4.5 | CHARGE NEUTRALITY

In thermal equilibrium, the semiconductor crystal is electrically neutral. The electrons are distributed among the various energy states, creating negative and positive charges, but the net charge density is zero. This charge-neutrality condition is used to determine the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations as a function of the impurity doping concentration. We will define a compensated semiconductor and then determine the electron and hole concentrations as a function of the donor and acceptor concentrations.

### 4.5.1 Compensated Semiconductors

A **compensated semiconductor** is one that contains both donor and acceptor impurity atoms in the same region. A compensated semiconductor can be formed, for example, by diffusing acceptor impurities into an n-type material or by diffusing donor impurities into a p-type material. An n-type compensated semiconductor occurs when \( N_d > N_a \), and a p-type compensated semiconductor occurs when \( N_a > N_d \). If \( N_d = N_a \), we have a completely compensated semiconductor that has, as we will show, the characteristics of an intrinsic material. Compensated semiconductors are created quite naturally during device fabrication as we will see later.
