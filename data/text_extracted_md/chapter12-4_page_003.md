If the neutral widths of both the polysilicon and single-crystal portions of the emitter are much smaller than the respective diffusion lengths, then the minority carrier distribution functions will be linear in each region. Both the minority carrier concentration and diffusion current must be continuous across the polysilicon/silicon interface. We can therefore write

\[
eD_{E(\text{poly})} \frac{d(\delta p_{E(\text{poly})})}{dx} = eD_{E(\text{cr})} \frac{d(\delta p_{E(\text{cr})})}{dx}
\]

(12.106a)

or

\[
\frac{d(\delta p_{E(\text{cr})})}{dx} = \frac{D_{E(\text{poly})}}{D_{E(\text{cr})}} \cdot \frac{d(\delta p_{E(\text{poly})})}{dx}
\]

(12.106b)

Since \( D_{E(\text{poly})} < D_{E(\text{cr})} \), then the gradient of the minority carrier concentration at the emitter edge of the Bâ€“E depletion region in the \( n^+ \) region is reduced as Figure 12.47 shows. This implies that the current back-injected from the base into the emitter is reduced so that the common-emitter current gain is increased.
