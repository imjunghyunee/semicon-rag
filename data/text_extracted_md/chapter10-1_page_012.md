# 10.1.4 Work Function Differences

We have been concerned, so far, with the energy-band diagrams of the semiconductor material. Figure 10.13a shows the energy levels in the metal, silicon dioxide (SiO₂), and silicon relative to the vacuum level. The metal work function is \( \phi_m \), and the electron affinity is \( \chi \). The parameter \( \chi_i \) is the oxide electron affinity and, for SiO₂, \( \chi_i = 0.9 \, \text{V} \).

Figure 10.13b shows the energy-band diagram of the entire MOS structure with zero gate voltage applied. The Fermi level is a constant through the entire system at thermal equilibrium. We may define \( \phi_m' \) as a modified metal work function—the potential required to inject an electron from the metal into the conduction band of the oxide. Similarly, \( \chi' \) is defined as a modified electron affinity. The voltage \( V_{ox0} \) is the potential drop across the oxide for zero applied gate voltage and is not necessarily zero because of the difference between \( \phi_m \) and \( \chi \). The potential \( \phi_s \) is the surface potential for this case.

If we sum the energies from the Fermi level on the metal side to the Fermi level on the semiconductor side, we have

\[
e\phi_m' + eV_{ox0} = e\chi' + \frac{E_t}{2e} - e\phi_s + e\phi_{Fi}
\]

(10.13)

Equation (10.13) can be rewritten as

\[
V_{ox0} + \phi_s = - \left[ \phi_m' - \left( \chi' + \frac{E_t}{2e} + \phi_{Fi} \right) \right]
\]
