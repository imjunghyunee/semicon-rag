# CHAPTER 11 Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor: Additional Concepts

**snapback**  
The negative resistance effect during breakdown in a MOSFET caused by the variable current gain in a parasitic bipolar transistor.

**subthreshold conduction**  
The process of current conduction in a MOSFET when the transistor is biased below the threshold inversion point.

**surface scattering**  
The process of electric field attraction and coulomb repulsion of carriers at the oxide–semiconductor interface as the carriers drift between source and drain.

**threshold adjustment**  
The process of altering the threshold voltage by changing the semiconductor doping concentration through ion implantation.
