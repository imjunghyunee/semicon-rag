### 13.2 The Device Characteristics

then formed between the source and drain contacts. The forward-bias gate voltage must not be too large or an undesirable gate current will be present in the device.

#### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 13.6** An n-channel GaAs MESFET has a gate barrier height of \(\phi_{bn} = 0.89 \, \text{V}\). The channel doping concentration is \(N_D = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\). What channel thickness is required to yield a threshold voltage of \(V_T = 0.25 \, \text{V}\)?

*(unit 08C0 = D - SUY)*

Ideally, the I-V characteristics of the enhancement mode device are the same as the depletion mode deviceâ€”the only real difference is the relative values of the internal pinchoff voltage. The current in the saturation region is given by Equation (13.35) as

\[
I_{D1} = I_{D1}(\text{sat}) = I_{p1} \left\{ 1 - 3 \left[ 1 - \frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \right] + 2 \left[ 1 - \frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \right]^{\frac{3}{2}} \right\}
\]

The threshold voltage for the n-channel device is defined in Equation (13.42) as \(V_T = V_{bi} - V_{p0}\), so we can also write

\[
V_{bi} = V_T + V_{p0}
\]

(13.43)

Substituting this expression for \(V_{bi}\) into Equation (13.35), we obtain

\[
I_{D1}(\text{sat}) = I_{p1} \left\{ 1 - 3 \left[ 1 - \frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \right] + 2 \left[ 1 - \frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \right]^{\frac{3}{2}} \right\}
\]

(13.44)

Equation (13.44) is valid for \(V_{GS} \geq V_T\).

When the transistor first turns on, we have \((V_{GS} - V_T) \ll V_{p0}\). Equation (13.44) can then be expanded into a Taylor series and we obtain

\[
I_{D1}(\text{sat}) \approx I_{p1} \left[ \frac{3}{4} \left( \frac{V_{GS} - V_T}{V_{p0}} \right)^2 \right]
\]

(13.45)

Substituting the expressions for \(I_{p1}\) and \(V_{p0}\), Equation (13.45) becomes

\[
I_{D1}(\text{sat}) = \frac{\mu_n \epsilon_s W}{2aL} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \quad \text{for} \quad V_{GS} \geq V_T
\]

(13.46)

We can now write Equation (13.46) as

\[
I_{D1}(\text{sat}) = k_n (V_{GS} - V_T)^2
\]

(13.47)

where

\[
k_n = \frac{\mu_n \epsilon_s W}{2aL}
\]

(13.48)

The factor \(k_n\) is called a conduction parameter. The form of Equation (13.47) is the same as for a MOSFET.
