# 15.4 Power Bipolar Transistors

Devices can be designed to operate in the 100 GHz or higher frequency range and produce power outputs of a few watts. The efficiency of these devices is in the range of 10 to 15 percent, and these devices provide the highest continuous output power of all the semiconductor microwave devices. As with most semiconductor device designs, other structures can be fabricated to provide specialized output characteristics.

## 15.4.1 Power Bipolar Transistors

In our previous discussions, we have ignored any physical transistor limitations in terms of maximum current, voltage, and power. We implicitly assumed that the transistors are capable of handling the current and voltage, and could handle the power dissipated within the device without suffering any damage.

However, with power transistors, we must be concerned with various transistor limitations. The limitations involve maximum rated current (on the order of amperes), maximum rated voltage (on the order of 100 V), and maximum rated power (on the order of watts or tens of watts).[^1]

### 15.4.1 Vertical Power Transistor Structure

Figure 15.10 shows the structure of a vertical npn power transistor. We have considered vertical npn bipolar transistors previously. However, with small switching devices, the collector terminal is still formed at the surface. In the vertical configuration for the power bipolar transistor, the collector terminal is at the “bottom” of the device. This configuration is preferred since it maximizes the cross-sectional area through which current is flowing in the device. In addition, the doping concentrations
