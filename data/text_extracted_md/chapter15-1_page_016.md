is performed over the entire surface followed by the n\(^+\) source diffusion. A V-shaped groove is then formed, extending through the n-drift region. It has been found that certain chemical solutions etch the (111) planes in silicon at a much slower rate than the other planes. If (100) oriented silicon is etched through a window at the surface, these chemical etches will create a V-shaped groove. A gate oxide is then grown in the V-shaped groove and the metal gate material is deposited. An electron inversion layer is formed in the base or substrate so that current is again essentially a vertical current between the source and the drain. The relatively low-doped n-drift region supports the drain voltage since the depletion region extends mainly into this low-doped region.

We mentioned that many individual MOSFET cells are connected in parallel to fabricate a power MOSFET with the proper width-to-length ratio. Figure 15.22 shows a HEXFET structure. Each cell is a DMOS device with an n\(^+\) polysilicon gate. The HEXFET has a very high packing densityâ€”it may be on the order of 10\(^5\) cells per cm\(^2\). In the VMOS structure, the anisotropic etching of the grooves must be along the [110] direction on the (100) surface. This constraint limits the design options available for this type of device.

### 15.5.2 Power MOSFET Characteristics

Table 15.2 lists the basic parameters of two n-channel power MOSFETs. The drain currents are in the ampere range and the breakdown voltages are in the hundreds of volts range.

An important parameter of a power MOSFET is the **on resistance**, which can be written as

\[
R_{\text{on}} = R_S + R_{\text{CH}} + R_D \tag{15.9}
\]

where \( R_S \) is the resistance associated with the source contact, \( R_{\text{CH}} \) is the channel resistance, and \( R_D \) is the resistance associated with the drain contact. The \( R_S \) and \( R_D \)
