# CHAPTER 14 Optical Devices

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 14.5** The doping concentrations of the photodiode described in Example 14.5 are changed to \( N_a = N_d = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). (a) Determine the steady-state photocurrent density. (b) Calculate the ratio of prompt photocurrent to steady-state photocurrent.  
\[
\left[ \frac{L}{L_0} = \frac{\tau}{\tau'} (q) : \frac{J_{UV}}{J_{L0}} = \frac{\tau'}{\tau} (b) \, \text{SUV} \right]
\]

In this example calculation, \( L_n \gg W \) and \( L_p \gg W \). In many pn junction structures, the assumption of a long diode will not be valid, so the photocurrent expression will have to be modified. In addition, the photon energy absorption may not be uniform throughout the pn structure. The effect of nonuniform absorption will be considered in the next section.

### 14.3.3 PIN Photodiode

In many photodetector applications, the speed of response is important; therefore, the prompt photocurrent generated in the space charge region is the only photocurrent of interest. To increase the photodetector sensitivity, the depletion region width should be made as large as possible. This can be achieved in a PIN photodiode.

The PIN diode consists of a p region and an n region separated by an intrinsic region. A sketch of a PIN diode is shown in Figure 14.19a. The intrinsic region width \( W \) is much larger than the space charge width of a normal pn junction. If a reverse bias is applied to the PIN diode, the space charge region extends completely through the intrinsic region.
