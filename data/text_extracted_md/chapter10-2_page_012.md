# CHAPTER 10 Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

!Energy-band diagram

**Figure 10.32** | Energy-band diagram in a p-type semiconductor showing the charge trapped in the interface states when the MOS capacitor is biased (a) in accumulation, (b) at midgap, and (c) at inversion.

The intrinsic Fermi level at the surface; thus, all interface states are neutral. This particular bias condition is known as **midgap**. Figure 10.32c shows the condition at inversion in which there is now a net negative charge in the acceptor states.

The net charge in the interface states changes from positive to negative as the gate voltage sweeps from the accumulation, depletion, to the inversion condition. We noted that the C–V curves shifted in the negative gate voltage direction due to positive fixed oxide charge. When interface states are present, the amount and direction of the shift change as we sweep through the gate voltage, since the amount and sign of the interface trapped charge change. The C–V curves now become “smeared out” as shown in Figure 10.33.

Again, the C–V measurements can be used as a diagnostic tool in semiconductor device process control. For a given MOS device, the ideal C–V curve can be determined.
