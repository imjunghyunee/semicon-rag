**Figure 5.10** | Electron concentration versus distance.

If the distance an electron travels between collisions (\(l < v_n \tau_n\)), then on the average, electrons moving to the right at \(x = -l\) and electrons moving to the left at \(x = +l\) will cross the \(x = 0\) plane. One half of the electrons at \(x = -l\) will be traveling to the right at any instant of time and one half of the electrons at \(x = +l\) will be traveling to the left at any given time. The net rate of electron flow, \(F_n\), in the \(+x\) direction at \(x = 0\) is given by

\[
F_n = \frac{1}{2} n(-l)v_{th,n} - \frac{1}{2} n(+l)v_{th,n} = \frac{1}{2} v_{th}[n(-l) - n(+l)]
\]

(5.29)

If we expand the electron concentration in a Taylor series about \(x = 0\) keeping only the first two terms, then we can write Equation (5.29) as

\[
F_n = \frac{1}{2} v_{th} \left[ n(0) - \frac{dn}{dx} - n(0) + \frac{dn}{dx} \right]
\]

(5.30)

which becomes

\[
F_n = -v_{th} l \frac{dn}{dx}
\]

(5.31)

Each electron has a charge \((-e)\), so the current is

\[
J = -eF_n = e v_{th} l \frac{dn}{dx}
\]

(5.32)

The current described by Equation (5.32) is the electron diffusion current and is proportional to the spatial derivative, or density gradient, of the electron concentration.

The diffusion of electrons from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration produces a flux of electrons flowing in the negative \(x\) direction for this example. Since electrons have a negative charge, the conventional current direction is in the positive \(x\) direction. Figure 5.11a shows these one-dimensional flux and
