# Collector Current and Current Gain Effects

Figure 12.49 shows the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration through the base region of the SiGe and Si transistors. This concentration is given by

\[
n_{bo} = \frac{{n_i^2}}{{N_B}}
\]

(12.107)

where \( N_B \) is assumed to be constant. The intrinsic concentration, however, is a function of the bandgap energy. We may write

\[
\frac{{n_i^2(\text{SiGe})}}{{n_i^2(\text{Si})}} = \exp\left(\frac{{\Delta E_g}}{{kT}}\right)
\]

(12.108)

where \( n_i(\text{SiGe}) \) is the intrinsic carrier concentration in the SiGe material, \( n_i(\text{Si}) \) is the intrinsic carrier concentration in the Si material, and \( \Delta E_g \) is the change in the bandgap energy of the SiGe material compared to that of Si.

The collector current in a SiGe-base transistor will increase. As a first approximation, we can see this from the previous analysis. The collector current is found from Equation (12.36a), in which the derivative is evaluated at the base–collector junction. This means that the value of \( n_{bo} \) in the collector current expression in Equation (12.37) is made at the base–collector junction. Since this value is larger for the SiGe-base transistor (Figure 12.49), the collector current will be larger compared to the Si-base transistor. Since the base currents are the same in the two transistors, the increase in collector current then implies that the current gain in the SiGe-base transistor is larger. If the bandgap narrowing is 100 meV, then the increase in the collector current and current gain will be approximately a factor of 4.

# Early Voltage Effects

The Early voltage in a SiGe-base transistor is larger than that of the Si-base transistor. The explanation for this effect is less obvious than the explanation for the increase in collector current and current gain. For a bandgap narrowing of 100 meV, the Early voltage is increased by approximately a factor of 12. Incorporating Ge into the base region can increase the Early voltage by a large factor.
