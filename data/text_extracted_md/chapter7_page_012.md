charges must increase if the electric field increases. For given impurity doping concentrations, the number of positive and negative charges in the depletion region can be increased only if the space charge width \( W \) increases. The space charge width \( W \) increases, therefore, with an increasing reverse-biased voltage \( V_R \). We are assuming that the electric field in the bulk n and p regions is zero. This assumption will become clearer in the next chapter when we discuss the currentâ€“voltage characteristics.

In all of the previous equations, the built-in potential barrier can be replaced by the total potential barrier. The total space charge width can be written from Equation (7.31) as

\[
W = \left[ \frac{2 \varepsilon_s (V_{bi} + V_R)}{e} \left( \frac{N_a + N_d}{N_a N_d} \right) \right]^{1/2}
\]

(7.34)

showing that the total space charge width increases as we apply a reverse-biased voltage. By substituting the total potential barrier \( V_{\text{total}} \) into Equations (7.28) and (7.29), the space charge widths in the n and p regions, respectively, can be found as a function of applied reverse-biased voltage.

**EXAMPLE 7.3**

**Objective:** Calculate the width of the space charge region in a pn junction when a reverse-biased voltage is applied.

Again consider a silicon pn junction at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) with doping concentrations of \( N_a = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( N_d = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Assume that \( n_i = 1.5 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( V_R = 5 \, \text{V} \).

**Solution**

The built-in potential barrier was calculated in Example 7.1 for this case and is \( V_{bi} = 0.635 \, \text{V} \). The space charge width is determined from Equation (7.34). We have

\[
W = \left[ \frac{2(11.7)(8.85 \times 10^{-14})(0.635 + 5)}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \right]^{1/2} \left[ \frac{10^{16} + 10^{15}}{(10^{16})(10^{15})} \right]^{1/2}
\]

so that

\[
W = 2.83 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm} = 2.83 \, \mu\text{m}
\]
