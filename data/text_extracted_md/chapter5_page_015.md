!Carrier drift velocity versus electric field

**Figure 5.7** Carrier drift velocity versus electric field for high-purity silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. (From Sze [14].)

The **drift velocity versus electric field curve** is the mobility. The behavior of the drift velocity of carriers at high electric fields deviates substantially from the linear relationship observed at low fields. The drift velocity of electrons in silicon, for example, saturates at approximately \(10^7 \, \text{cm/s}\) at an electric field of approximately 30 kV/cm. If the drift velocity of a charge carrier saturates, then the drift current density also saturates and becomes independent of the applied electric field.

The experimental carrier drift velocity versus electric field in silicon can be approximated for electrons by [2]

\[
v_n = \frac{v_s}{1 + \left(\frac{E_{eo}}{E}\right)^{1/2}}
\]

(5.27a)

and for holes by

\[
v_p = \frac{v_s}{1 + \left(\frac{E_{op}}{E}\right)^{1/2}}
\]

(5.27b)

The variables are \(v_s = 10^7 \, \text{cm/s}\) at \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\), \(E_{eo} = 7 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/cm}\), and \(E_{op} = 2 \times 10^4 \, \text{V/cm}\).

We may note that for small electric fields, the drift velocities reduce to

\[
v_n = \left(\frac{E}{E_{eo}}\right) \cdot v_s
\]

(5.28a)

and

\[
v_p = \left(\frac{E}{E_{op}}\right) \cdot v_s
\]
