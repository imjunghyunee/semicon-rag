# 8.5 The Tunnel Diode

!Energy-band diagrams and I-V characteristics

**Figure 8.29** | Simplified energy-band diagrams and \( I \text{-} V \) characteristics of the tunnel diode at (a) zero bias; (b) a slight forward bias; (c) a forward bias producing maximum tunneling current. *(continued)*

- **(a)** Zero bias: The energy-band diagram shows no applied voltage, and the corresponding \( I \text{-} V \) characteristic is at the origin.
- **(b)** Slight forward bias: The energy-band diagram indicates a small forward voltage, and the \( I \text{-} V \) curve begins to rise.
- **(c)** Forward bias producing maximum tunneling current: The energy-band diagram shows increased forward bias, and the \( I \text{-} V \) curve reaches a peak.
