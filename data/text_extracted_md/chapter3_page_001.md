## Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

In the last chapter, we applied quantum mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave equation to determine the behavior of electrons in the presence of various potential functions. We found one important characteristic of an electron bound to an atom or bound within a finite space to be that the electron can take on only discrete values of energy; that is, the energies are quantized. We also discussed the Pauli exclusion principle, which stated that only one electron is allowed to occupy any given quantum state. In this chapter, we will generalize these concepts to the electron in a crystal lattice.

One of our goals is to determine the electrical properties of a semiconductor material, which we will then use to develop the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Toward this end, we have two tasks in this chapter: to determine the properties of electrons in a crystal lattice and to determine the statistical characteristics of the very large number of electrons in a crystal.

In this chapter, we will:

- Develop the concept of allowed and forbidden electron energy bands in a single-crystal material, and describe conduction and valence energy bands in a semiconductor material.
- Discuss the concept of negatively charged electrons and positively charged holes as two distinct charge carriers in a semiconductor material.
- Develop electron energy versus momentum curves in a single-crystal material, which yields the concept of direct and indirect bandgap semiconductor materials.
- Discuss the concept of effective mass of an electron and a hole.
- Derive the density of quantum states in the allowed energy bands.
