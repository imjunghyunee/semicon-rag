The current crowding effect is schematically shown in Figure 12.28. The larger current density near the emitter edge may cause localized heating effects as well as localized high-injection effects. The nonuniform emitter current also results in a nonuniform lateral base current under the emitter. A two-dimensional analysis would be required to calculate the actual potential drop versus distance because of the nonuniform base current. Another approach is to slice the transistor into a number of smaller parallel transistors and to lump the resistance of each base section into an equivalent external resistance.

Power transistors, designed to handle large currents, require large emitter areas to maintain reasonable current densities. To avoid the current crowding effect, these transistors are usually designed with narrow emitter widths and fabricated with an interdigitated design. Figure 12.29 shows the basic geometry. In effect, many narrow emitters are connected in parallel to achieve the required emitter area.
