# CHAPTER 14 Optical Devices

- The photon absorption process has been discussed and the absorption coefficient data for semiconductors has been presented.
- Solar cells convert optical power into electrical power. The simple pn junction solar cell was initially considered. The short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power were considered.
- Heterojunction and amorphous silicon solar cells were also considered. Heterojunction cells can be fabricated that tend to increase the conversion efficiency and produce relatively large open-circuit voltages. Amorphous silicon offers the possibility of low-cost, large-area solar cell arrays.
- Photodetectors are semiconductor devices that convert optical signals into electrical signals. The photoconductor is perhaps the simplest type of photodetector. The change in conductivity of the semiconductor due to the creation of excess electrons and holes by the incident photons is the basis of this device.
- Photodiodes are diodes that have reverse-biased voltages applied. Excess carriers that are created by incident photons in the space-charge region are swept out by the electric field creating a photocurrent. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the incident photon intensity. PIN and avalanche photodiodes are variations of the basic photodiode.
- The photocurrent generated in a phototransistor is multiplied by the transistor gain. However, the time response of the phototransistor may be slower than that of a photodiode because of the Miller effect and Miller capacitance.
- The inverse mechanism of photon absorption in a pn junction is injection electroluminescence. The recombination of excess electrons and holes in a direct bandgap semiconductor can result in the emission of photons.
- The light emitting diodes (LEDs) are the class of pn junction diodes whose photon output is a result of spontaneous recombinations of excess electrons and holes. A fairly wide bandwidth in the output signal, on the order of 30 nm, is a result of the spontaneous process.
- The output of a laser diode is the result of stimulated emission. An optical cavity, or Fabryâ€“Perot resonator, is used in conjunction with a diode so that the photon output is in phase, or coherent. Multilayered heterojunction structures can be fabricated to improve the laser diode characteristics.

## GLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS

- **absorption coefficient**: The relative number of photons absorbed per unit distance in a semiconductor and denoted by the parameter \(\alpha\).

- **conversion efficiency**: The ratio of output electrical power to incident optical power in a solar cell.

- **delayed photocurrent**: The component of photocurrent in a semiconductor device due to diffusion currents.

- **external quantum efficiency**: The ratio of emitted photons to generated photons in a semiconductor device.

- **fill factor**: The ratio \(I_m V_m\) to \(I_{sc} V_{oc}\), which is a measure of the realizable power from a solar cell. The parameters \(I_m\) and \(V_m\) are the current and voltage at the maximum power point, respectively, and \(I_{sc}\) and \(V_{oc}\) are the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.

- **Fresnel loss**: The ratio of reflected to incident photons at an interface due to a change in the index of refraction.
