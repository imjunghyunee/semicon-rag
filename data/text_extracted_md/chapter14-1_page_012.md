## 14.2.4 The Heterojunction Solar Cell

As we have mentioned in previous chapters, a heterojunction is formed between two semiconductors with different bandgap energies. A typical pN heterojunction energy-band diagram in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 14.12. Assume that photons are incident on the wide-bandgap material. Photons with energy less than \(E_{gN}\) will pass through the wide-bandgap material, which acts as an optical window, and photons with energies greater than \(E_{gP}\) will be absorbed in the narrow bandgap material. On the average, excess carriers created in the depletion region and within a diffusion length of the junction will be collected and will contribute to the photocurrent. Photons with an energy greater than \(E_{gN}\) will be absorbed in the wide-bandgap material.
