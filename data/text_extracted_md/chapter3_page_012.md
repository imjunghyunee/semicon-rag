### 3.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands

!Figure 3.8

**Figure 3.8** A plot of (a) the first term in Equation (3.29), (b) the second term in Equation (3.29), and (c) the entire \( f(\alpha a) \) function. The shaded areas show the allowed values of \( (\alpha a) \) corresponding to real values of \( k \).

The parameter \( \alpha \) is related to the total energy \( E \) of the particle through Equation (3.5), which is \( \alpha^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2} \). A plot of the energy \( E \) of the particle as a function of the wave number \( k \) can be generated from Figure 3.8c. **Figure 3.9 shows this plot and thus shows the concept of allowed energy bands for the particle propagating in the crystal lattice.** Since the energy \( E \) has discontinuities, we also have the concept of forbidden energies for the particles in the crystal.

#### Objective:
Determine the width (in eV) of a forbidden energy band. Determine the width of the forbidden bandgap that exists at \( ka = \pi \) (see Figure 3.9). Assume that the coefficient \( p' = 8 \) and the potential width is \( a = 4.5 \, \text{Ã…} \).

#### Solution
Combining Equations (3.29) and (3.30), we have

\[
\cos ka = p' \frac{\sin \alpha a}{\alpha a} + \cos \alpha a
\]
