# 5.1 Carrier Drift

At low electric fields, the drift velocities are linear functions of the electric field as we have discussed. However, for large electric fields, the drift velocities approach the saturation value.

The drift velocity versus electric field characteristic of gallium arsenide is more complicated than for silicon or germanium. At low fields, the slope of the drift velocity versus E-field is constant and is the low-field electron mobility, which is approximately 8500 cm\(^2\)/VÂ·s for gallium arsenide. The low-field electron mobility in gallium arsenide is much larger than in silicon. As the field increases, the electron drift velocity in gallium arsenide reaches a peak and then decreases. A differential mobility is the slope of the \(v_d\) versus E curve at a particular point on the curve and the negative slope of the drift velocity versus electric field represents a negative differential mobility. The negative differential mobility produces a negative differential resistance; this characteristic is used in the design of oscillators.

The negative differential mobility can be understood by considering the E versus k diagram for gallium arsenide, which is shown again in Figure 5.8. The density of states effective mass of the electron in the lower valley is \(m_n^* = 0.067 m_0\). The small effective mass leads to a large mobility. As the E-field increases, the energy of the electron increases and the electron can be scattered into the upper valley, where the density of states effective mass is 0.55\(m_0\). The larger effective mass in the upper valley yields a smaller mobility. This intervalley transfer mechanism results in a decreasing average drift velocity of electrons with electric field, or the negative differential mobility characteristic.
