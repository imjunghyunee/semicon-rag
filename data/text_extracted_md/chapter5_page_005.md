**Figure 5.1** Typical random behavior of a hole in a semiconductor (a) without an electric field and (b) with an electric field.

Between collisions which may be denoted by \( \tau_{mp} \). If a small electric field (E-field) is applied as indicated in Figure 5.1b, there will be a net drift of the hole in the direction of the E-field, and the net drift velocity will be a small perturbation on the random thermal velocity, so the time between collisions will not be altered appreciably. **If we use the mean time between collisions \( \tau_{mp} \) in place of the time \( t \) in Equation (5.11), then the mean peak velocity just prior to a collision or scattering event is**

\[
v_{\text{peak}} = \left( \frac{e \tau_{mp}}{m_{hp}} \right) E
\]

(5.12a)

The average drift velocity is one half the peak value so that we can write

\[
\langle v_d \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{e \tau_{mp}}{m_{hp}} \right) E
\]

(5.12b)

However, the collision process is not as simple as this model, but is statistical in nature. In a more accurate model including the effect of a statistical distribution, the factor \( \frac{1}{2} \) in Equation (5.12b) does not appear. The hole mobility is then given by

\[
\mu_p = \frac{v_d}{E} = \frac{e \tau_{mp}}{m_{hp}}
\]

(5.13)

The same analysis applies to electrons; thus, we can write the electron mobility as

\[
\mu_n = \frac{e \tau_{mn}}{m_{hn}}
\]

(5.14)

where \( \tau_{mn} \) is the mean time between collisions for an electron.

There are two collision or scattering mechanisms that dominate in a semiconductor and affect the carrier mobility: phonon or lattice scattering, and ionized impurity scattering.

The atoms in a semiconductor crystal have a certain amount of thermal energy at temperatures above absolute zero that causes the atoms to randomly vibrate about their lattice position within the crystal. The lattice vibrations cause a disruption in the perfect periodic potential function. A perfect periodic potential in a solid allows...
