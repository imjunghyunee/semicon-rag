In the remainder of the chapter, we consider the operation and characteristics of the bipolar transistor in more detail.

### 12.2.1 Minority Carrier Distribution

We are interested in calculating currents in the bipolar transistor that, as in the simple pn junction, are determined by minority carrier diffusion. Since diffusion currents are produced by minority carrier gradients, we must determine the steady-state minority carrier distribution in each of the three transistor regions. Let us first consider the forward-active mode, and then the other modes of operation. Table 12.1 summarizes the notation used in the following analysis.
