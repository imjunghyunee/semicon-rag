### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 4.11**  
Consider silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \). Calculate the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations for impurity concentrations of (a) \( N_A = 4 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), \( N_D = 8 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and (b) \( N_D = N_A = 3 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).  
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{(a)} & \quad \underline{n_0 = 0.01 \times 1 = 0.01} \quad \underline{p_0 = 0.01 \times 20 = 0.2} \quad \underline{n_0 = 0.01 \times 7 = 0.07} \\
\text{(b)} & \quad \underline{n_0 = 0.01 \times 1 = 0.01} \quad \underline{p_0 = 0.01 \times 7 = 0.07}
\end{align*}
\]

We may note that, for a compensated p-type semiconductor, the minority carrier electron concentration is determined from
\[
n_0 = \frac{n_i^2}{p_0} = \frac{n_i^2}{(N_A - N_D)}
\]

Equations (4.60) and (4.62) are used to calculate the majority carrier electron concentration in an n-type semiconductor and majority carrier hole concentration in a p-type semiconductor, respectively. The minority carrier hole concentration in an n-type semiconductor could, theoretically, be calculated from Equation (4.62). However, we would be subtracting two numbers on the order of \( 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), for example, to obtain a number on the order of \( 10^4 \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), which from a practical point of view is not possible. The minority carrier concentrations are calculated from \( n_0p_0 = n_i^2 \) once the majority carrier concentration has been determined.

### TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 4.11**  
Consider a compensated GaAs semiconductor at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) doped at \( N_A = 5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( N_D = 2 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Calculate the thermal equilibrium electron and hole concentrations.  
\[
\underline{n_0 = 0.01 \times 9 = 0.09} \quad \underline{p_0 = 0.01 \times 1 = 0.01}
\]

**TYU 4.12**  
Silicon is doped at \( N_A = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( N_D = 0 \). (a) Plot the concentration of electrons versus temperature over the range 300 K to 600 K. (b) Calculate the temperature at which the electron concentration is equal to \( 1.1 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).  
\[
\underline{n_0 = 0.01 \times 1 = 0.01}
\]

**TYU 4.13**  
A silicon device with n-type material is to be operated at \( T = 550 \, \text{K} \). At this temperature, the intrinsic carrier concentration must contribute no more than 5 percent of the total electron concentration. Determine the minimum donor concentration required to meet this specification.  
\[
\underline{n_0 = 0.01 \times 0.1 = 0.01}
\]

### 4.6 | POSITION OF FERMI ENERGY LEVEL

We have discussed qualitatively in Section 4.3.1 how the electron and hole concentrations change as the Fermi energy level moves through the bandgap energy. Then, in Section 4.5, we calculated the electron and hole concentrations as a function of donor and acceptor impurity concentrations. We can now determine the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping concentrations and as a function of temperature. The relevance of the Fermi energy level will be further discussed after the mathematical derivations.
