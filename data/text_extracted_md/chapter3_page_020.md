The energy band may be approximated by a parabola, just as that of a free particle. We may write

\[
E - E_c = C_1 k^2
\]

(3.44)

The energy \( E_c \) is the energy at the bottom of the band. Since \( E > E_c \), the parameter \( C_1 \) is a positive quantity.

Taking the second derivative of \( E \) with respect to \( k \) from Equation (3.44), we obtain

\[
\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = 2C_1
\]

(3.45)

We may put Equation (3.45) in the form

\[
\frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \frac{2C_1}{\hbar^2}
\]

(3.46)

Comparing Equation (3.46) with Equation (3.41), we may equate \( \hbar^2/2C_1 \) to the mass of the particle. However, the curvature of the curve in Figure 3.16a will not, in general, be the same as the curvature of the free-particle curve. We may write

\[
\frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \frac{2C_1}{\hbar^2} = \frac{1}{m^*}
\]

(3.47)

where \( m^* \) is called the effective mass. Since \( C_1 > 0 \), we have that \( m^* > 0 \) also.

The effective mass is a parameter that relates the quantum mechanical results to the classical force equations. In most instances, the electron in the bottom of the conduction band can be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled by Newtonian mechanics, provided that the internal forces and quantum mechanical properties are taken into account through the effective mass. If we apply an electric field to the electron in the bottom of the allowed energy band, we may write the acceleration as

\[
a = \frac{-eE}{m^*_e}
\]

(3.48)

where \( m^*_e \) is the effective mass of the electron. The effective mass \( m^*_e \) of the electron near the bottom of the conduction band is a constant.
