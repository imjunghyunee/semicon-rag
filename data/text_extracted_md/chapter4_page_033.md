# CHAPTER 4 The Semiconductor in Equilibrium

**Comment**

In both parts of this example, \((N_d - N_a) \gg n_i\), so the **thermal-equilibrium majority carrier electron concentration** is essentially equal to the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations. Also, in both cases, the majority carrier electron concentration is orders of magnitude larger than the minority carrier hole concentration.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 4.9** Find the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations in silicon with doping concentrations of \(N_d = 7 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) and \(N_a = 3 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) for (a) \(T = 250 \, \text{K}\) and (b) \(T = 400 \, \text{K}\).

\[
\begin{align*}
&\text{[} q \cdot \text{(} w_s \cdot s)01 \times y = w \cdot (q) \cdot i_w \cdot \Sigma \text{]} = q \cdot t_w \cdot (w_s)01 \times y = w \cdot (y) \cdot stv \text{]}
\end{align*}

We have argued in our discussion and we may note from the results of Example 4.9 that the concentration of electrons in the conduction band increases above the intrinsic carrier concentration as we add donor impurity atoms. At the same time, the minority carrier hole concentration decreases below the intrinsic carrier concentration as we add donor atoms. We must keep in mind that as we add donor impurity atoms and the corresponding donor electrons, there is a redistribution of electrons among available energy states. Figure 4.15 shows a schematic of this physical redistribution. A few of the donor electrons will fall into the empty states in the valence band and, in doing so, will annihilate some of the intrinsic holes. The minority carrier hole concentration will therefore decrease as we have seen in Example 4.9. At the
