The bandgap energy decreases with temperature. We will show that the bandwidth of the emission spectra can be greatly reduced in a laser diode by using an optical resonator.

## 14.4.2 Luminescent Efficiency

We have shown that not all recombination processes are radiative. An efficient luminescent material is one in which radiative transitions predominate. The quantum efficiency is defined as the ratio of the radiative recombination rate to the total recombination rate for all processes. We can write

\[
\eta_q = \frac{R_r}{R}
\]

(14.49)

where \( \eta_q \) is the quantum efficiency, \( R_r \) is the radiative recombination rate, and \( R \) is the total recombination rate of the excess carriers. Since the recombination rate is
