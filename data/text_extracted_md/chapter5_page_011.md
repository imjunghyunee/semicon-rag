**Figure 5.5** | Bar of semiconductor material as a resistor.

If we have a bar of semiconductor material as shown in Figure 5.5 with a voltage applied that produces a current \( I \), then we can write

\[
J = \frac{I}{A}
\]
(5.21a)

and

\[
E = \frac{V}{L}
\]
(5.21b)

We can now rewrite Equation (5.19) as

\[
\frac{I}{A} = \sigma \left( \frac{V}{L} \right)
\]
(5.22a)

or

\[
V = \left( \frac{L}{\sigma A} \right) I = \left( \frac{\rho L}{A} \right) I = IR
\]
(5.22b)

Equation (5.22b) is Ohmâ€™s law for a semiconductor. The resistance is a function of resistivity, or conductivity, as well as the geometry of the semiconductor.

If we consider, for example, a p-type semiconductor with an acceptor doping \( N_a(N_d = 0) \) in which \( N_a \gg n_i \) and if we assume that the electron and hole mobilities are of the same order of magnitude, then the conductivity becomes

\[
\sigma = e(\mu_n n + \mu_p p) \approx e \mu_p p
\]
(5.23)

If we also assume complete ionization, then Equation (5.23) becomes

\[
\sigma \approx e \mu_p N_a \approx \frac{1}{\rho}
\]
(5.24)

The conductivity and resistivity of an extrinsic semiconductor are a function primarily of the majority carrier parameters.
