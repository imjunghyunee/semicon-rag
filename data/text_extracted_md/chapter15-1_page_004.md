!Energy-band Structure of GaAs

**Figure 15.4.1** Energy-band structure of GaAs showing the lower valley and upper valley in the conduction band.

Conduction band exist in the lower valley of the E versus \( k \) diagram, where the density of states electron effective mass is small. A small effective mass leads to a large mobility value.

As the electric field increases above a threshold or critical value, \( E_{th} \), the electrons gain more than the 0.3 eV energy separating the two valleys so that electrons can be scattered into the upper valley, where the density of states electron effective mass is much larger. The larger effective mass yields a smaller mobility. The intervalley transfer mechanism with a change in mobility results in a decreasing average drift velocity of electrons with electric field, or a negative differential electron mobility. The maximum negative differential electron mobility in GaAs is approximately \(-2400 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{s}\).

Consider a two-terminal n-type GaAs device with ohmic contacts at the ends that is biased in the negative mobility region (\( E_{\text{bias}} > E_{th} \)) as shown in Figure 15.5a. A small space charge region may develop in the material near the cathode as shown in Figure 15.5b. As a result, the electric field increases in this region as shown in Figure 15.5c. (Special device structures can be fabricated to ensure that the space charge fluctuations are generated near the cathode.)
