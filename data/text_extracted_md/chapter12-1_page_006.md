**Figure 12.6** | Minority carrier distributions and basic currents in a forward-biased npn bipolar transistor.

The diffusion of electrons is in the \(+x\) direction so that the conventional current is in the \(-x\) direction. Considering magnitudes only, Equation (12.1) can be written as

\[
i_c = I_S \exp \left( \frac{v_{BE}}{V_T} \right)
\]

(12.2)

The collector current is controlled by the base–emitter voltage; that is, the current at one terminal of the device is controlled by the voltage applied to the other two terminals of the device. As we have mentioned, this is the basic transistor action.

### Emitter Current

One component of emitter current, \(i_{E1}\), shown in Figure 12.6 is due to the flow of electrons injected from the emitter into the base. This current, then, is equal to the collector current given by Equation (12.1).

Since the base–emitter junction is forward biased, majority carrier holes in the base are injected across the B–E junction into the emitter. These injected holes produce a pn junction current \(i_{E2}\) as indicated in Figure 12.6. This current is only a B–E junction current so this component of emitter current is not part of the collector current. Since \(i_{E2}\) is a forward-biased pn junction current, we can write (considering magnitude only)

\[
i_{E2} = I_{S2} \exp \left( \frac{v_{BE}}{V_T} \right)
\]
