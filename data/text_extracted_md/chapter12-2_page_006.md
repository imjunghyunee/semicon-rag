# Chapter 12: The Bipolar Transistor

Then from Equation (12.44), the recombination factor is found as

\[
\delta = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{J_0}{J_s} \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{V_{BE}}{2V_T}\right)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-7}}{1.804 \times 10^{-9}} \cdot \exp\left(\frac{-0.50}{2(0.0259)}\right)}
\]

\[
= 0.99574
\]

**Comment**  
This simple example shows a typical magnitude of the recombination factor.

## Exercise Problem

**Ex 12.3** Repeat Example 12.3 for \( V_{BE} = 0.65 \, \text{V} \). \( 9(6660 = 9 \, \text{suv}) \)

The recombination factor must also include surface effects. The surface effects can be described by the surface recombination velocity as we discussed in Chapter 6. Figure 12.20a shows the B–E junction of an npn transistor near the semiconductor surface. We assume that the B–E junction is forward biased. Figure 12.20b shows the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the base along the cross section A–A'. This curve is the usual forward-biased junction minority carrier concentration. Figure 12.20c shows the excess minority carrier electron concentration along the cross section C–C' from the surface. We have showed earlier that the excess concentration at a surface is smaller than the excess concentration in the bulk material. With this electron distribution, there is a diffusion of electrons from the bulk toward the surface where the electrons recombine with the majority carrier holes. Figure 12.20d shows the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base and the diffusion of
