If the Fermi energy changes from near the midgap value, the density of electrons in the conduction band and the density of holes in the valence band will change. These effects are shown in Figures 4.8 and 4.9. Figure 4.8 shows the case for \( E_F > E_{Fi} \) and Figure 4.9 shows the case for \( E_F < E_{Fi} \). When \( E_F > E_{Fi} \), the electron concentration is larger than the hole concentration, and when \( E_F < E_{Fi} \), the hole concentration is larger than the electron concentration. When the density of electrons is greater than the density of holes, the semiconductor is n type; donor impurity atoms have been added. When the density of holes is greater than the density of electrons, the semiconductor is p type; acceptor impurity atoms have been added. The Fermi energy level in a semiconductor changes as the electron and hole concentrations change and, again, the Fermi energy changes as donor or acceptor impurities are added. The change in the Fermi level as a function of impurity concentrations is considered in Section 4.6.
