## 3.2.2 Drift Current

Current is due to the net flow of charge. If we had a collection of positively charged ions with a volume density \( N \, (\text{cm}^{-3}) \) and an average drift velocity \( v_d \, (\text{cm/s}) \), then the drift current density would be

\[
J = qNv_d \quad \text{A/cm}^2
\]

(3.32)

If, instead of considering the average drift velocity, we considered the individual ion velocities, then we could write the drift current density as

\[
J = q \frac{1}{V} \sum_{i=1}^{M} v_i
\]

(3.33)

where \( v_i \) is the velocity of the \( i \)th ion. The summation in Equation (3.33) is taken over a unit volume so that the current density \( J \) is still in units of A/cm\(^2\).

Since electrons are charged particles, a net drift of electrons in the conduction band will give rise to a current. The electron distribution in the conduction band, as shown in Figure 3.14b, is an even function of \( k \) when no external force is applied. Recall that \( k \) for a free electron is related to momentum so that, since there are as many electrons with a \( +|k| \) value as there are with a \( -|k| \) value, the net drift current density due to these electrons is zero. This result is certainly expected since there is no externally applied force.

If a force is applied to a particle and the particle moves, it must gain energy. This effect is expressed as

\[
dE = F \, dx = F \, v \, dt
\]

(3.34)

where \( F \) is the applied force, \( dx \) is the differential distance the particle moves, \( v \) is the velocity, and \( dE \) is the increase in energy. If an external force is applied to the electrons in the conduction band, there are empty energy states into which the electrons can move; therefore, because of the external force, electrons can gain energy and a
