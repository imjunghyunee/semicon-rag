### CHAPTER 4 The Semiconductor in Equilibrium

where

\[
\eta' = \frac{E_c - E}{kT}
\]

(4.49a)

and

\[
\eta'_F = \frac{E_c - E_F}{kT}
\]

(4.49b)

The integral in Equation (4.48) is the same Fermiâ€“Dirac integral defined by Equation (4.47), although the variables have slightly different definitions. We may note that if \(\eta'_F > 0\), then the Fermi level is in the valence band.

#### 4.3.4 Degenerate and Nondegenerate Semiconductors

In our discussion of adding dopant atoms to a semiconductor, we have implicitly assumed that the concentration of dopant atoms added is small when compared to the density of host or semiconductor atoms. The small number of impurity atoms are spread far enough apart so that there is no interaction between donor electrons, for example, in an n-type material. We have assumed that the impurities introduce discrete, noninteracting donor energy states in the n-type semiconductor and discrete, noninteracting acceptor states in the p-type semiconductor. These types of semiconductors are referred to as nondegenerate semiconductors.

If the impurity concentration increases, the distance between the impurity atoms decreases and a point will be reached when donor electrons, for example, will begin to interact with each other. When this occurs, the single discrete donor energy will split into a band of energies. As the donor concentration further increases, the band of donor states widens and may overlap the bottom of the conduction band. This overlap occurs when the donor concentration becomes comparable with the effective density of states. When the concentration of electrons in the conduction band exceeds the density of states \(N_c\), the Fermi energy lies within the conduction band. This type of semiconductor is called a degenerate n-type semiconductor.

In a similar way, as the acceptor doping concentration increases in a p-type semiconductor, the discrete acceptor energy states will split into a band of energies and may overlap the top of the valence band. The Fermi energy will lie in the valence band when the concentration of holes exceeds the density of states \(N_v\). This type of semiconductor is called a degenerate p-type semiconductor.

Schematic models of the energy-band diagrams for a degenerate n-type and degenerate p-type semiconductor are shown in Figure 4.11. The energy states below \(E_F\)
