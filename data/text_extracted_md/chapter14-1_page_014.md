# 14.2 Solar Cells

A very large area solar cell array to generate the required power. Amorphous silicon solar cells provide the possibility of fabricating large area and relatively inexpensive solar cell systems.

When silicon is deposited by CVD techniques at temperatures below 600Â°C, an amorphous film is formed regardless of the type of substrate. In amorphous silicon, there is only very short range order, and no crystalline regions are observed. Hydrogen may be incorporated in the silicon to reduce the number of dangling bonds, creating a material called hydrogenated amorphous silicon.

The density of states versus energy for amorphous silicon is shown in Figure 14.14. Amorphous silicon contains large numbers of electronic energy states within the normal bandgap of single-crystal silicon. However, because of the short-range order, the effective mobility is quite small, typically in the range between \(10^{-6}\) and \(10^{-3} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V-s}\). The mobilities in the states above \(E_c\) and below \(E_v\) are between 1 and 10 \(\text{cm}^2/\text{V-s}\). Consequently, conduction through the energy states between \(E_c\) and \(E_v\) is negligible because of the low mobility. Because of the difference in mobility values, \(E_c\) and \(E_v\) are referred to as the mobility edges and the energy between \(E_c\) and \(E_v\) is referred to as the mobility gap. The mobility gap can be modified by adding specific types of impurities. Typically, the mobility gap is on the order of 1.7 eV.

Amorphous silicon has a very high optical absorption coefficient, so most sunlight is absorbed within approximately \(1 \, \mu m\) of the surface. Consequently, only a
