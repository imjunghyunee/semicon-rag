# Glossary of Important Terms

**abrupt junction approximation**  
The assumption that there is an abrupt discontinuity in space charge density between the space charge region and the neutral semiconductor region.

**avalanche breakdown**  
The process whereby a large reverse-biased pn junction current is created due to the generation of electron–hole pairs by the collision of electrons and/or holes with atomic electrons within the space charge region.

**built-in potential barrier**  
The electrostatic potential difference between the p and n regions of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium.

**critical electric field**  
The peak electric field in the space charge region at breakdown.

**depletion layer capacitance**  
Another term for junction capacitance.

**depletion region**  
Another term for space charge region.

**hyperabrupt junction**  
A pn junction in which the doping concentration on one side decreases away from the metallurgical junction to achieve a specific capacitance–voltage characteristic.

**junction capacitance**  
The capacitance of the pn junction under reverse bias.

**linearly graded junction**  
A pn junction in which the doping concentrations on either side of the metallurgical junction are approximated by a linear distribution.

**metallurgical junction**  
The interface between the p- and n-doped regions of a pn junction.

**one-sided junction**  
A pn junction in which one side of the junction is much more heavily doped than the adjacent side.

**reverse bias**  
The condition in which a positive voltage is applied to the n region with respect to the p region of a pn junction so that the potential barrier between the two regions increases above the thermal-equilibrium built-in potential barrier.

**space charge region**  
The region on either side of the metallurgical junction in which there is a net charge density due to ionized donors in the n region and ionized acceptors in the p region.

**space charge width**  
The width of the space charge region, a function of doping concentrations and applied voltage.

**varactor diode**  
A diode whose reactance can be varied in a controlled manner with bias voltage.
