- Describe qualitatively the four time-delay or time-constant components in the frequency response of the bipolar transistor.

## Review Questions

1. Describe the charge flow in an npn bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode. Is the current by drift or diffusion?
2. Define the common-emitter current gain and explain why, to a first approximation, the current gain is a constant. What is the relation between the common-emitter and common-base current gains?
3. Explain the conditions of the cutoff, saturation, and inverse-active modes.
4. Sketch the minority carrier concentrations in a pnp bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode.
5. Define and describe the three limiting factors in the common-base current gain. Why does the base doping concentration affect the emitter injection efficiency?
6. Describe base width modulation. Sketch an I–V curve that shows the base width modulation effect.
7. What is meant by high injection?
8. Explain emitter current crowding.
9. Define \( I_{CBO} \) and \( I_{CEO} \) and explain why \( I_{CEO} > I_{CBO} \).
