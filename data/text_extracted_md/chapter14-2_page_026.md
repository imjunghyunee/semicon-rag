# Review Questions

### Internal Quantum Efficiency
The fraction of diode current that produces luminescence.

### LASER Diode
An acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation: the stimulated emission of photons produced in a forward-biased pn junction in conjunction with an optical cavity.

### LED
An acronym for Light Emitting Diode; the spontaneous photon emission due to electron–hole recombination in a forward-biased pn junction.

### Luminescence
The general property of light emission.

### Open-Circuit Voltage
The voltage generated across the open-circuited terminals of a solar cell.

### Photocurrent
The current generated in a semiconductor device due to the flow of excess carriers generated by the absorption of photons.

### Population Inversion
The condition whereby the concentration of electrons in one energy state is greater than that in a lower energy state; a nonequilibrium condition.

### Prompt Photocurrent
The component of photocurrent generated within the space charge region of a semiconductor device.

### Radiative Recombination
The recombination process of electrons and holes that produces a photon, such as the direct band-to-band transition in gallium arsenide.

The current produced in a solar cell when the two terminals are shorted together.

### Stimulated Emission
The process whereby an electron is induced by an incident photon to make a transition to a lower energy state, emitting a second photon.
