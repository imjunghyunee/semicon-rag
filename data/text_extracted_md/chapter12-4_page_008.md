# 12.9 | SUMMARY

- There are two complementary bipolar transistors—npn and pnp. Each transistor has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions. The center region (base) is very narrow, so the two pn junctions are said to be interacting junctions.

- In the forward-active mode, the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C junction is reverse biased. Majority carriers from the emitter are injected into the base where they become minority carriers. These minority carriers diffuse across the base into the B–C space charge region where they are swept into the collector.

- When a transistor is biased in the forward-active mode of operation, the current at one terminal of the transistor (collector current) is controlled by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the transistor (base–emitter voltage). This is the basic transistor action.

- The minority carrier concentrations are determined in each region of the transistor. The principal currents in the device are determined by the diffusion of these minority carriers.

- The common-base current gain, which leads to the common-emitter current gain, is a function of three factors—emitter injection efficiency, base transport factor, and recombination factor. The emitter injection efficiency takes into account carriers from the base that are injected back into the emitter, the base transport factor takes into account recombination in the base region, and the recombination factor takes into account carriers that recombine within the forward-biased B–E junction.

- Several nonideal effects are considered:
  1. **Base width modulation, or Early effect**—the change in the neutral base width with a change in B–C voltage, producing a change in collector current with a change in B–C or C–E voltage.
  2. **High-injection effects** that cause the collector current to increase at a slower rate with base–emitter voltage.
  3. **Emitter bandgap narrowing** that produces a smaller emitter injection efficiency because of a very large emitter region doping concentration.
  4. **Current crowding effects** that produce a larger current density at the emitter edge than in the center of the emitter.
  5. A **nonuniform base doping concentration** that induces an electric field in the base region, which aids the flow of minority carriers across the base.
  6. Two **breakdown voltage mechanisms**—punch-through and avalanche.

- Three equivalent circuits or mathematical models of the transistor are considered. The Ebers–Moll model and equivalent circuit are applicable in any of the transistor operating modes. The Gummel–Poon model is convenient to use when nonuniform doping exists in the transistor. The small-signal hybrid-pi model applies to transistors operating in the forward-active mode in linear amplifier circuits.

- The cutoff frequency of a transistor, a figure of merit for the transistor, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain becomes equal to unity. The frequency response is a function of the emitter–base junction capacitance charging time, the base transit time, the collector depletion region transit time, and the collector capacitance charging time.

- The switching characteristics are closely related to the frequency limitations although switching involves large changes in currents and voltages. An important parameter in switching is the charge storage time, which applies to a transistor switching from saturation to cutoff.
