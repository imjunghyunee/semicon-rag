# 3.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands

But \(\Delta v \ll v_i\), so we have that

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1}{2} m (2v_i \Delta v) = mv_i \Delta v
\]

## Solution

Substituting the number into this equation, we obtain

\[
\Delta E = (9.11 \times 10^{-31})(10^7)(0.01) = 9.11 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{J}
\]

which may be converted to units of electron volts as

\[
\Delta E = \frac{9.11 \times 10^{-38}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 5.7 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{eV}
\]

## Comment

A change in velocity of 1 cm/s compared with \(10^7\) cm/s results in a change in energy of \(5.7 \times 10^{-19}\) eV, which is orders of magnitude larger than the change in energy of \(10^{-19}\) eV between energy states in the allowed energy band. This example serves to demonstrate that a difference in adjacent energy states of \(10^{-19}\) eV is indeed very small, so that the discrete energies within an allowed band may be treated as a quasi-continuous distribution.

## Exercise Problem

**Ex 3.1** The initial velocity of an electron is \(10^7\) cm/s. If the kinetic energy of the electron increases by \(\Delta E = 10^{-12}\) eV, determine the increase in velocity.

\[
(s\mu) - .01 \, \mu \ll 1 = qv \, s\mu
\]

Consider again a regular periodic arrangement of atoms, in which each atom now contains more than one electron. Suppose the atom in this imaginary crystal contains electrons up through the \(n = 3\) energy level. If the atoms are initially very far apart, the electrons in adjacent atoms will not interact and will occupy the discrete energy levels. If these atoms are brought closer together, the outermost electrons in the \(n = 3\) energy shell will begin to interact initially, so that this discrete energy level will split into a band of allowed energies. If the atoms continue to move closer together, the electrons in the \(n = 2\) shell may begin to interact and will also split into a band of allowed energies. Finally, if the atoms become sufficiently close together, the innermost electrons in the \(n = 1\) level may interact, so that this energy level may also split into a band of allowed energies. The splitting of these discrete energy levels is qualitatively shown in Figure 3.3. If the equilibrium interatomic distance is \(r_0\), then we have bands of allowed energies that the electrons may occupy separated by bands of forbidden energies. This energy-band splitting and the formation of allowed and forbidden bands is the energy-band theory of single-crystal materials.

The actual band splitting in a crystal is much more complicated than indicated in Figure 3.3. A schematic representation of an isolated silicon atom is shown in Figure 3.4a. Ten of the 14 silicon atom electrons occupy deep-lying energy levels close to the nucleus. The four remaining valence electrons are relatively weakly bound and are the electrons involved in chemical reactions. Figure 3.4b shows the band splitting of silicon. We need only consider the \(n = 3\) level for the valence.
