# 13.5 High Electron Mobility Transistor

The electrons in the potential well are now separated from the impurity dopant atoms in the AlGaAs; thus, impurity scattering tends to be minimized.

The FETs fabricated from these heterojunctions are known by several names. The term used here is the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Other names include modulation-doped field-effect transistor (MODFET), selectively doped heterojunction field-effect transistor (SDHT), and two-dimensional electron gas field-effect transistor (TEGFET).

## 13.5.1 Quantum Well Structures

Figure 13.23 shows the conduction-band energy of an N-AlGaAs–intrinsic GaAs heterojunction. A two-dimensional surface channel layer of electrons is formed in the thin potential well (~80Å) in the undoped GaAs. Electron sheet carrier densities on the order of \(10^{12} \, \text{cm}^{-2}\) have been obtained. An improvement in the low-field mobility of the carriers moving parallel to the heterojunction is observed since the impurity-scattering effects are reduced. At 300 K, mobilities have been reported in the range of 8500–9000 \(\text{cm}^2/\text{V·s}\), whereas GaAs MESFETs doped to \(N_d = 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) have low-field mobilities of less than 5000 \(\text{cm}^2/\text{V·s}\). The electron mobility in the heterojunction now tends to be dominated by lattice or phonon scattering, so that as the temperature is reduced, the mobility increases rapidly.

Impurity-scattering effects can be further reduced by increasing the separation of the electrons and ionized donor impurities. The electrons in the potential well of the abrupt heterojunction shown in Figure 13.23 are separated from the donor atoms, but are still close enough to be subjected to a coulomb attraction. A thin spacer layer of undoped AlGaAs can be placed between the doped AlGaAs and the undoped GaAs. Figure 13.24 shows the energy-band diagram for this structure.
