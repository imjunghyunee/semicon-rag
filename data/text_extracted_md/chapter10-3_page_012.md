# CHAPTER 10 Fundamentals of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 10.9** A silicon MOSFET has the following parameters: \( N_A = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( t_{ox} = 12 \, \text{nm} = 120 \, \text{Å} \). Calculate (a) the body-effect coefficient and (b) the change in threshold voltage for (i) \( V_{SB} = 1 \) and (ii) \( V_{SB} = 2 \, \text{V} \).

\[ \Lambda Z9I 0 = 4V \, (I) \, \Lambda 5E00 = 4V \, (q) \, \tau \Lambda 00Z 0 = \Lambda \, (q) \, \text{suv} \]

If a body or substrate bias is applied to a p-channel device, the threshold voltage is shifted to more negative values. Because the threshold voltage of a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET is negative, a body voltage will increase the applied negative gate voltage required to create inversion. The same general observation was made for the n-channel MOSFET.

## TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

- **TYU 10.6** The silicon n-channel MOSFET described in Exercise Problem Ex 10.7 is to be redesigned by changing the \( W/L \) ratio such that \( I_D = 100 \, \mu \text{A} \) when the transistor is biased in the saturation region with \( V_{GS} = 1.0 \, \text{V} \).

  \[ (8G1 = 7/\Lambda \, \text{suv}) \]

- **TYU 10.7** The parameters of a p-channel MOSFET are \( \mu_p = 310 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{s} \), \( t_{ox} = 220 \, \text{Å} \), \( W/L = 60 \), and \( V_T = -0.40 \, \text{V} \). If the transistor is biased in the saturation region, find the drain current for \( V_{GS} = 1, 1.5, \) and \( 2 \, \text{V} \).

  \[ (\nu t \mu e \, pue \, L1 \, \text{`9C0} = q \, \text{suv}) \]

- **TYU 10.8** The p-channel MOSFET in TYU 10.7 is to be redesigned by changing the \( (W/L) \) ratio such that \( I_D = 200 \, \mu \text{A} \) when the transistor is biased in the saturation region with \( V_{GS} = 1.25 \, \text{V} \).

  \[ (\gamma 11 = 7/\Lambda \, \text{suv}) \]

- **TYU 10.9** Repeat Exercise Problem Ex 10.9 for a substrate impurity doping concentration of \( N_A = 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

  \[ \Lambda 9C500 = 4V \, (I) \, \Lambda 1E00 = 4V \, (q) \, \tau \Lambda 9E90 0 = \Lambda \, (q) \, \text{suv} \]

## 10.4 FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS

In many applications, the MOSFET is used in a linear amplifier circuit. A small-signal equivalent circuit for the MOSFET is needed in order to mathematically analyze the electronic circuit. The equivalent circuit contains capacitances and resistances that introduce frequency effects. We initially develop a small-signal equivalent circuit and then discuss the physical factors that limit the frequency response of the MOSFET. A transistor cutoff frequency, which is a figure of merit, is then defined and an expression derived for this factor.

The small-signal equivalent circuit of the MOSFET is constructed from the basic MOSFET geometry. A model based on the inherent capacitances and resistances...
