## 8.2 Generationâ€“Recombination Currents and High-Injection Levels

neglect the \((-1)\) term in the numerator and the \((+1)\) term in the denominator. Equation (8.51) then becomes

\[
R_{\text{max}} = \frac{n_i}{2\tau_0} \exp\left(\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\right)
\]

(8.52)

The recombination current density may be calculated from

\[
J_{\text{rec}} = \int_0^W eR \, dx
\]

(8.53)

where again the integral is over the entire space charge region. In this case, however, the recombination rate is not a constant through the space charge region. We have calculated the maximum recombination rate at the center of the space charge region, so we may write

\[
J_{\text{rec}} = ex' \frac{n_i}{2\tau_0} \exp\left(\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\right)
\]

(8.54)

where \(x'\) is a length over which the maximum recombination rate is effective. However, since \(\tau_0\) may not be a well-defined or known parameter, it is customary to write

\[
J_{\text{rec}} = \frac{eWn_i}{2\tau_0} \exp\left(\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\right) = J_0 \exp\left(\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\right)
\]

(8.55)

where \(W\) is the space charge width.

### Total Forward-Bias Current

The total forward-bias current density in the pn junction is the sum of the recombination and the ideal diffusion current densities. Figure 8.15 shows a plot of the minority carrier hole concentration in the neutral

!Figure 8.15

**Figure 8.15** Because of recombination, additional holes from the p region must be injected into the space charge region to establish the minority carrier hole concentration in the n region.
