# CHAPTER 3 Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

!Figure 3.27

**Figure 3.27** The density of energy states in the conduction band and the density of energy states in the valence band as a function of energy.

## EXAMPLE 3.4

**Objective:** Determine the number (#/cm³) of quantum states in silicon between \( E_c \) and \( E_c + kT \) at \( T = 300 \, K \).

### Solution

Using Equation (3.72), we can write

\[
N = \int_{E_c}^{E_c + kT} \frac{4\pi (2m_n^*)^{3/2}}{h^3} \sqrt{E - E_c} \cdot dE
\]

\[
= \frac{4\pi (2m_n^*)^{3/2}}{h^3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot (E - E_c)^{3/2} \bigg|_{E_c}^{E_c + kT}
\]

\[
= \frac{4\pi (2 \times 1.08 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31})^{3/2}}{(6.625 \times 10^{-34})^3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot [(0.0259) \times (1 \times 10^{-19})]^{3/2}
\]

\[
= 2.12 \times 10^3 \, \text{m}^{-3}
\]

or

\[
N = 2.12 \times 10^{19} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

### Comment

The result of this example shows the order of magnitude of the density of quantum states in a semiconductor.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

Ex3.4 Determine the number (#/cm³) of quantum states in silicon between \( (E_v - kT) \) and \( E_v \) at \( T = 300 \, K \).
