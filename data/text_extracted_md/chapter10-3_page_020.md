bipolar transistors, respectively. One method of preventing latch-up is to “kill” the minority carrier lifetime. Minority carrier lifetime degradation can be accomplished by gold doping or neutron irradiation, either of which introduces deep traps within the semiconductor. The deep traps increase the excess minority carrier recombination rate and reduce current gain. A second method of preventing latch-up is by using proper circuit layout techniques. If the two bipolar transistors can be effectively decoupled, then latch-up can be minimized or prevented. The two parasitic bipolar transistors can also be decoupled by using a different fabrication technology. The silicon-on-insulator technology, for example, allows the n-channel and the p-channel MOSFETs to be isolated from each other by an insulator. This isolation decouples the parasitic bipolar transistors.

## 10.6 | SUMMARY

- The fundamental physics and characteristics of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) have been considered in this chapter.
- The heart of the MOSFET is the MOS capacitor. The energy bands in the semiconductor adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface bend, depending upon the voltage applied to the gate.
- An inversion layer of electrons can be created at the oxide–semiconductor surface in a p-type semiconductor by applying a sufficiently positive gate voltage, and an inversion layer of holes can be created at the oxide–semiconductor surface in an n-type semiconductor by applying a sufficiently negative gate voltage.
- The threshold voltage is the applied gate voltage required to reach the threshold inversion point. The flat-band voltage was defined and discussed.
