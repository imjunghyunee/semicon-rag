There are several possible energy-band conditions to consider. Figure 3.19a shows an allowed energy band that is completely empty of electrons. If an electric field is applied, there are no particles to move, so there will be no current. Figure 3.19b shows another allowed energy band whose energy states are completely full of electrons. We argued in the previous section that a completely full energy band will also not give rise to a current. A material that has energy bands either completely empty or completely full is an insulator. The resistivity of an insulator is very large or, conversely, the conductivity of an insulator is very small. There are essentially no charged particles that can contribute to a drift current. Figure 3.19c shows a simplified energy-band diagram of an insulator. The bandgap energy \( E_g \) of an insulator is usually on the order of 3.5 to 6 eV or larger, so that at room temperature, there are essentially no electrons in the conduction band and the valence band remains completely full. There are very few thermally generated electrons and holes in an insulator.

Figure 3.20a shows an energy band with relatively few electrons near the bottom of the band. Now, if an electric field is applied, the electrons can gain energy, move to higher energy states, and move through the crystal. The net flow of charge is a current. Figure 3.20b shows an allowed energy band that is almost full of electrons, which means that we can consider the holes in this band. If an electric field is applied, the holes can move and give rise to a current. Figure 3.20c shows the simplified energy-band diagram for this case. The bandgap energy may be on the order of 1 eV.
