The junction diffusion capacitance and \( r_s \) is the junction diffusion resistance. The diffusion capacitance \( C_e \) is the same as the diffusion capacitance \( C_d \) given by Equation (8.105), and the diffusion resistance \( r_e \) is the same as the diffusion resistance \( r_d \) given by Equation (8.68). The values of both parameters are functions of the junction.
