# 11.3 Threshold Voltage Modifications

or

\[ W = 0.708 \, \mu m \]

**Comment**

We may note that the threshold voltage shift of \(\Delta V_T = 0.2 \, V\) occurs at a channel width of \(W = 0.708 \, \mu m\), which is approximately four times larger than the induced space charge width \(x_{sp}\).

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex. 11.4** Repeat Example 11.4 for \(N_a = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) and \(t_{ox} = 8 \, \text{nm} = 80 \, \text{Ã…}\). Determine the channel width such that the threshold voltage shift is limited to \(\Delta V_T = 0.1 \, V\).

*(unit \(\mu F/50 = \mu \, \text{V})*

----

Figure 11.19 shows the threshold voltage as a function of channel width. We can again note that the threshold voltage shift begins to become apparent for channel widths that are large compared to the induced space charge width.

Figure 11.20a, b shows qualitatively the threshold voltage shifts due to short-channel and narrow-channel effects, respectively, in n-channel MOSFETs. The narrow-channel device produces a larger threshold voltage; the short-channel device produces a smaller threshold voltage. For devices exhibiting both short-channel and narrow-channel effects, the two models need to be combined into a three-dimensional volume approximation of the space charge region controlled by the gate.
