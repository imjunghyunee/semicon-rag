# 10.1 The Two-Terminal MOS Structure

!Energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor

**Figure 10.7** The energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate for (a) a positive gate bias, (b) a moderate negative bias, and (c) a "large" negative gate bias.

- **(a)** Positive voltage applied: Accumulation of electrons.
- **(b)** Negative voltage applied: Induced positive space charge region.
- **(c)** "Large" negative voltage: Inversion layer of holes.

The potential is the potential difference across the space charge layer. The space charge width can now be written in a form similar to that of a one-sided pn junction. We can write that

\[
x_d = \left( \frac{2 \varepsilon_s \phi_b}{e N_A} \right)^{1/2}
\]

(10.5)

where \(\varepsilon_s\) is the permittivity of the semiconductor. Equation (10.5) assumes that the abrupt depletion approximation is valid.
