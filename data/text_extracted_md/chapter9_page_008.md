# CHAPTER 9 Metal–Semiconductor and Semiconductor Heterojunctions

**TYU 9.2** Repeat TYU 9.1 for an ideal palladium-n-type GaAs Schottky diode with the same impurity concentration. 

\[ [\mu_{n}]_{L=0} \times 9.89 = J_{0} (P) \]

\[ \text{w} / A \, 0.1 \times L = \frac{1}{\text{w}} (Q) : \, \Delta 616'0 = \Delta (4) : \, \Delta SO1 = \omega \Phi (V) \, \text{SVJ} \]

## 9.1.3 Nonideal Effects on the Barrier Height

### Schottky Barrier Lowering

Several effects alter the actual Schottky barrier height from the theoretical value given by Equation (9.1). The first such effect that we consider is the Schottky effect, or image-force-induced lowering of the potential barrier.

An electron in a dielectric material at a distance \( x \) from the metal will create an electric field. The electric field can be determined by adding an image charge, \( +e \), inside the metal located at the same distance, \( |x| \), from the interface. This image effect is shown in Figure 9.4a. Note that the E–field lines are perpendicular to the metal surface as we expect. The force on the electron, due to the coulomb attraction with the image force, is

\[
F = \frac{-e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_{e}(2x)^2} = -eE
\]
