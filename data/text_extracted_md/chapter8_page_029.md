**Figure 8.17** | Forward-bias current versus voltage from low forward bias to high forward bias.

In the high-level injection region, it takes a larger increase in diode voltage to produce a given increase in diode current.

The diode forward-bias current, from low-bias levels to high-bias levels, is plotted in Figure 8.17. This plot shows the effect of recombination at low-bias voltages and high-level injection at high-bias voltages.

**TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING**

**TYU 8.4** Consider a silicon pn junction diode at \( T = 300 \, K \) with parameters \( N_s = 2 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), \( N_i = 8 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), \( D_n = 10 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \), \( D_p = 25 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \), and \( \tau_p = \tau_n = 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \). The diode is forward biased at \( V_a = 0.35 \, \text{V} \). (a) Calculate the ideal diode current density. (b) Find the forward-biased recombination current density. (c) Determine the ratio of recombination current to the ideal diffusion current.

\[ \text{Use: } \frac{I_s}{q} \cdot \frac{W}{V_t} \cdot 0.1 \times 0.025 \cdot \frac{q}{W} \cdot 0.1 \times \frac{L}{T} \cdot \frac{V}{W} \]

## 8.3 | SMALL-SIGNAL MODEL OF THE pn JUNCTION

We have been considering the dc characteristics of the pn junction diode. When semiconductor devices with pn junctions are used in linear amplifier circuits, for example, sinusoidal signals are superimposed on the dc currents and voltages, so that the small-signal characteristics of the pn junction become important.
