|---------|-------------------------------|

The semiconductor work function, and \( \chi \) is known as the electron affinity. The work functions of various metals are given in Table 9.1 and the electron affinities of several semiconductors are given in Table 9.2. In Figure 9.1a, we have assumed that \( \phi_m > \phi_n \). The ideal thermal-equilibrium metalâ€“semiconductor energy-band diagram, for this situation, is shown in Figure 9.1b. Before contact, the Fermi level in the semiconductor was above that in the metal. In order for the Fermi level to become a constant through the system in thermal equilibrium, electrons from the semiconductor flow into the lower energy states in the metal. Positively charged donor atoms remain in the semiconductor, creating a space charge region.

The parameter \( \phi_{B0} \) is the ideal barrier height of the semiconductor contact, the potential barrier seen by electrons in the metal trying to move into the semiconductor. This barrier is known as the Schottky barrier and is given, ideally, by

\[
\phi_{B0} = (\phi_m - \chi)
\]

(9.1)

On the semiconductor side, \( V_{bi} \) is the built-in potential barrier. This barrier, similar to the case of the pn junction, is the barrier seen by electrons in the conduction band trying to move into the metal. The built-in potential barrier is given by

\[
V_{bi} = \phi_{B0} - \phi_n
\]

(9.2)

which makes \( V_{bi} \) a slight function of the semiconductor doping, as is the case in a pn junction.

If we apply a positive voltage to the semiconductor with respect to the metal, the semiconductor-to-metal barrier height increases, while \( \phi_{B0} \) remains constant in this idealized case. This bias condition is the reverse bias. If a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to the semiconductor, the semiconductor-to-metal barrier \( V_{bi} \) is reduced while \( \phi_{B0} \) again remains essentially constant. In this situation, electrons can more easily flow from the semiconductor into the metal since the barrier has been reduced. This bias condition is the forward bias. The energy-band diagrams for the reverse and forward bias are shown in Figures 9.2a,b where \( V_R \) is the magnitude of the reverse-biased voltage and \( V_a \) is the magnitude of the forward-bias voltage.
