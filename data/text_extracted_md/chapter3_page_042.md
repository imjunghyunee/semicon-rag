# Review Questions

### Definitions

- **electron effective mass**  
  The parameter that relates the acceleration of an electron in the conduction band of a crystal to an external force; a parameter that takes into account the effect of internal forces in the crystal.

- **Fermi–Dirac probability function**  
  The function describing the statistical distribution of electrons among available energy states and the probability that an allowed energy state is occupied by an electron.

- **fermi energy**  
  In the simplest definition, the energy below which all states are filled with electrons and above which all states are empty at \( T = 0 \, \text{K} \).

- **forbidden energy band**  
  A band or range of energy levels that an electron in a crystal is not allowed to occupy based on quantum mechanics.

- **hole**  
  The positively charged “particle” associated with an empty state in the top of the valence band.

- **hole effective mass**  
  The parameter that relates the acceleration of a hole in the valence band of a crystal to an applied external force (a positive quantity); a parameter that takes into account the effect of internal forces in a crystal.

- **k-space diagram**  
  The plot of electron energy in a crystal versus \( k \), where \( k \) is the momentum-related constant of the motion that incorporates the crystal interaction.

- **Kronig–Penney model**  
  The mathematical model of a periodic potential function representing a one-dimensional single-crystal lattice by a series of periodic step functions.

- **Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation**  
  The condition in which the energy is several \( kT \) above the Fermi energy or several \( kT \) below the Fermi energy so that the Fermi–Dirac probability function can be approximated by a simple exponential function.
