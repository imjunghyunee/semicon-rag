- (a) Potential function of a single isolated atom.
- (b) Overlapping potential functions of adjacent atoms.
- (c) Net potential function of a one-dimensional single crystal.

**Figure 3.6** 
The one-dimensional periodic potential function of the Kronig–Penney model.

- **(a)**: Shows the potential function \( V(x) \) for a single atom with energy levels \( E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4 \).
- **(b)**: Illustrates overlapping potential functions for multiple atoms.
- **(c)**: Depicts the net potential function for a one-dimensional crystal.

The potential function \( V(x) \) is shown with periodic barriers and wells, representing the Kronig–Penney model. The potential is periodic with intervals \( -a-b \) to \( a+b \), with potential \( V_0 \) in the barriers.
