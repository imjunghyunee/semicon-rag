# 3.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands

- Develop the Fermi-Dirac probability function, which describes the statistical distribution of electrons among the allowed energy levels, and define the Fermi energy level.

## 3.1.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands

In the last chapter, we considered the one-electron, or hydrogen, atom. That analysis showed that the energy of the bound electron is quantized: Only discrete values of electron energy are allowed. The radial probability density for the electron was also determined. This function gives the probability of finding the electron at a particular distance from the nucleus and shows that the electron is not localized at a given radius. We can extrapolate these single-atom results to a crystal and qualitatively derive the concepts of allowed and forbidden energy bands. We will then apply quantum mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave equation to the problem of an electron in a single crystal. We find that the electronic energy states occur in bands of allowed states that are separated by forbidden energy bands.

### Formation of Energy Bands

Figure 3.1a shows the radial probability density function for the lowest electron energy state of the single, noninteracting hydrogen atom, and Figure 3.1b shows the same probability curves for two atoms that are in close proximity to each other. The wave functions of the electrons of the two atoms overlap, which means that the two electrons will interact. This interaction or perturbation results in the discrete quantized energy level splitting into two discrete energy levels, schematically shown in Figure 3.1c. The splitting of the discrete state into two states is consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle.

A simple analogy of the splitting of energy levels by interacting particles is the following. Two identical race cars and drivers are far apart on a race track. There is no interaction between the cars, so they both must provide the same power to achieve a given speed. However, if one car pulls up close behind the other car, there is an interaction called draft. The second car will be pulled to an extent by the lead car. The lead car will therefore require more power to achieve the same speed since it is pulling the second car, and the second car will require less power since it is being pulled.
