**Figure 12.15** Hyperbolic sine function and its linear approximation.

Using the approximation that \(\sinh(x) \approx x\) for \(x \ll 1\), the excess electron concentration in the base is given by

\[
\delta n_{b}(x) \approx \frac{n_{b0}}{x_{b}} \left[ \left( \exp \left( \frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \right) - 1 \right) (x_{B} - x) - x \right]
\]

(12.15b)

We use this linear approximation later in some of the example calculations. The difference in the excess carrier concentrations determined from Equations (12.15a) and (12.15b) is demonstrated in the following exercise.

### TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 12.1** The emitter and base of a silicon npn bipolar transistor are uniformly doped at impurity concentrations of \(10^{18} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) and \(10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\), respectively. A forward-bias Bâ€“E voltage of \(V_{BE} = 0.610 \, \text{V}\) is applied. The neutral base width is \(x_B = 2 \, \mu\text{m}\) and the minority carrier diffusion length in the base is \(L_B = 10 \, \mu\text{m}\). Calculate the excess minority carrier concentration in the base at (a) \(x = 0\) and (b) \(x = x_B/2\). (c) Determine the ratio of the actual minority carrier concentration at \(x = x_B/2\) [Equation (12.15a)] to that in the ideal case of a linear minority carrier distribution [Equation (12.15b)].

\[ 
\begin{align*}
\text{[05660} &= \text{(r,01} \times 7\text{06,1/r,01} \times L\text{68'1} = \text{OHE} \, (q) \, \text{,u0,01} \times L\text{68'1} \\
&= (z/xq) \, \text{u (z/xq)+uq (q) : ,u0,r01} \times 18\text{E = (o)} \, \text{u (w) sUV]}
\end{align*}
\]

Table 12.2 shows the Taylor expansions of some of the hyperbolic functions that are encountered in this section of the chapter. In most cases, we consider only the linear terms when expanding these functions.
