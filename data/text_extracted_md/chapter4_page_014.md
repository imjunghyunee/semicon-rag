# 4.2 Dopant Atoms and Energy Levels

!Energy-band diagram

**Figure 4.5** | The energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete donor energy state and (b) the effect of a donor state being ionized.

If a small amount of energy, such as thermal energy, is added to the donor electron, it can be elevated into the conduction band, leaving behind a positively charged phosphorus ion. The electron in the conduction band can now move through the crystal generating a current, while the positively charged ion is fixed in the crystal. This type of impurity atom donates an electron to the conduction band and so is called a **donor impurity atom**. The donor impurity atoms add electrons to the conduction band without creating holes in the valence band. The resulting material is referred to as an **n-type semiconductor** (n for the negatively charged electron).

Now consider adding a group III element, such as boron, as a **substitutional impurity** to silicon. The group III element has three valence electrons, which are all taken up in the covalent bonding. As shown in Figure 4.6a, one covalent bonding position appears to be empty. If an electron were to occupy this “empty” position, its energy would have to be greater than that of the valence electrons, since the net charge state of the boron atom would now be negative. However, the electron occupying this “empty” position does not have sufficient energy to be in the conduction band, so its energy is far smaller than the conduction-band energy. Figure 4.6b shows how valence electrons may gain a small amount of thermal energy and move about in the lattice.
