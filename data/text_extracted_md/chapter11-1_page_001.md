## Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor: Additional Concepts

In this chapter we present additional concepts that are commonly encountered in metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). These concepts include nonideal effects, small device geometry, breakdown, threshold voltage adjustment by ion implantation, and radiation effects. Although there are a multitude of details that become important when fabricating MOSFETs in ICs, we are able to consider only a few here. Many additional details can be found in more advanced texts.

In this chapter, we will:

- Describe and analyze subthreshold conduction, which is the phenomenon whereby current is induced in the channel before the defined threshold voltage is reached.
- Analyze channel length modulation, which is a characteristic of short-channel lengths and leads to a finite output resistance.
- Consider the effects of a decrease in carrier mobility due to increasing gate voltage.
- Analyze the effects of carrier saturation velocity. Carriers can easily reach their saturation velocity in short-channel devices.
- Discuss MOSFET scaling, which describes how various parameters must be changed as device size is decreased.
- Consider the deviations in threshold voltage due to small geometry devices, including short channel length devices and small channel width devices.
