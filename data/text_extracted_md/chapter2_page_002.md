## 2.1 Principles of Quantum Mechanics

Before we delve into the mathematics of quantum mechanics, there are three principles we need to consider: the principle of energy quanta, the wave–particle duality principle, and the uncertainty principle.

### 2.1.1 Energy Quanta

One experiment that demonstrates an inconsistency between experimental results and the classical theory of light is called the photoelectric effect. If monochromatic light is incident on a clean surface of a material, then under certain conditions, electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from the surface. According to classical physics, if the intensity of the light is large enough, the work function of the material will be overcome and an electron will be emitted from the surface independent of the incident frequency. This result is not observed. The observed effect is that at a constant incident intensity, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron varies linearly with frequency with a limiting frequency \( \nu = \nu_0 \), below which no photoelectron is produced. This result is shown in Figure 2.1. If the incident intensity varies at a constant frequency, the rate of photoelectron emission changes, but the maximum kinetic energy remains the same.

Planck postulated in 1900 that thermal radiation is emitted from a heated surface in discrete packets of energy called quanta. The energy of these quanta is given by \( E = h\nu \) where \( \nu \) is the frequency of the radiation and \( h \) is a constant now known as Planck’s constant (\( h = 6.625 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). Then in 1905, Einstein interpreted the photoelectric results by suggesting that the energy in a light wave is also contained in quanta.
