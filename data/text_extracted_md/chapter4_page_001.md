## The Semiconductor in Equilibrium

So far, we have been considering a general crystal and applying to it the concepts of quantum mechanics in order to determine a few of the characteristics of electrons in a single-crystal lattice. In this chapter, we apply these concepts specifically to a semiconductor material. **In particular, we use the density of quantum states in the conduction band and the density of quantum states in the valence band along with the Fermiâ€“Dirac probability function to determine the concentration of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively.** We also apply the concept of the Fermi energy to the semiconductor material.

This chapter deals with the semiconductor in equilibrium. **Equilibrium, or thermal equilibrium, implies that no external forces such as voltages, electric fields, magnetic fields, or temperature gradients are acting on the semiconductor. All properties of the semiconductor will be independent of time** in this case.

In this chapter, we will:

- Derive the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in a semiconductor as a function of the Fermi energy level.
- Discuss the process by which the properties of a semiconductor material can be favorably altered by adding specific impurity atoms to the semiconductor.
- Determine the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in a semiconductor as a function of the concentration of dopant atoms added to the semiconductor.
- Determine the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the concentrations of dopant atoms added to the semiconductor.
