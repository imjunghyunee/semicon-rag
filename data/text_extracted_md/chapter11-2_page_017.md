The change in slope indicates that the density of interface states is increasing with total dose.

The buildup of radiation-induced interface states occurs over a relatively long time period and is a very strong function of the applied electric field in the oxide. Figure 11.34 shows the radiation-induced interface state density versus time for several applied fields. The final interface state density is reached between 100 to 10,000 seconds after a pulse of ionizing radiation. Almost all models for the generation of radiation-induced interface states depend on the transport or trapping of radiation-generated holes near the Si-SiO\(_2\) interface. This transport and trapping process is time and field dependent, supporting the time and field dependence of the interface state buildup.

The sensitivity of the Si-SiO\(_2\) interface to the buildup of radiation-induced interface states is a strong function of device processing. The interface state buildup in aluminum-gate MOSFETs tends to be smaller than in polysilicon-gate devices. This difference is probably more a result of variations between the two processing technologies than an inherent difference. Hydrogen appears to be important in the radiation-induced interface state buildup—hydrogen tends to passivate dangling silicon bonds at the interface, reducing the preradiation density of interface states. However, devices passivated with hydrogen appear to be more susceptible to the buildup of radiation-induced interface states. The silicon–hydrogen bond at the interface may be broken by the radiation process, which leaves a dangling silicon bond that acts like an interface state trap. These traps at the interface have been identified through electron spin resonance experiments.

Interface states may seriously affect the MOSFET characteristics, which in turn can affect MOSFET circuit performance. Radiation-induced interface states can cause shifts in threshold voltage, affecting circuit performance as we have discussed. A reduction in mobility can affect the speed and output drive capability of a circuit.
