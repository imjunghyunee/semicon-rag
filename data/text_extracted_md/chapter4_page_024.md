For silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), \( N_c = 2.8 \times 10^{19} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and, from Figure 4.10, the Fermi–Dirac integral has a value of \( F_{1/2} (2) = 2.7 \). Then

\[
n_0 = 2 \left( \frac{2.8 \times 10^{19} \times 2.7}{\sqrt{\pi}} \right) = 8.53 \times 10^{19} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

**Comment**

Note that if we had used Equation (4.11), the thermal equilibrium value of \( n_0 \) would be \( n_0 = 2.08 \times 10^{20} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), which is incorrect since the Boltzmann approximation is not valid for this case.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**

Ex. 4.6 If \( n_0 = 1.5 \times 10^{20} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) in silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), determine the position of the Fermi level relative to the conduction-band energy \( E_c \).

We may use the same general method to calculate the thermal equilibrium concentration of holes. We obtain

\[
p_0 = 4 \left( \frac{2m_p^* kT}{h^2} \right)^{3/2} \int_0^\infty \frac{(\eta')^{1/2} d\eta'}{1 + \exp(\eta' - \eta_p)} \tag{4.48}
\]

\[
F_{1/2}(\eta_F) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\eta^{1/2} d\eta}{1 + \exp(\eta - \eta_F)}
