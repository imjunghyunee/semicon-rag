which yields 

\[ N_a = 1.64 \times 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \]

**Comment**

The results of this example show that \( N_a \gg N_d \); therefore the assumption of a one-sided junction was valid.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**

**Ex 7.6** The experimentally measured junction capacitance of a one-sided silicon n⁺p-junction biased at \( V_R = 3 \, \text{V} \) and at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) is \( C = 0.105 \, \text{pF} \). The built-in potential barrier is found to be \( V_b = 0.765 \, \text{V} \). The cross-sectional area is \( A = 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}^2 \). Find the doping concentrations.

A one-sided pn junction is useful for experimentally determining the doping concentrations and built-in potential.

## 7.4 | JUNCTION BREAKDOWN

In the last section, we determined the effects of applying a reverse-biased voltage across the pn junction. However, the reverse-biased voltage may not increase without limit; at some particular voltage, the reverse-biased current will increase rapidly. The applied voltage at this point is called the **breakdown voltage**.

Two physical mechanisms give rise to the reverse-biased breakdown in a pn junction: the **Zener effect** and the **avalanche effect**. Zener breakdown occurs in highly doped pn junctions through a tunneling mechanism. In a highly doped junction, the conduction and valence bands on opposite sides of the junction are sufficiently close during reverse bias that electrons may tunnel directly from the valence band on the p side into the conduction band on the n side. This tunneling process is schematically shown in Figure 7.12a.

The avalanche breakdown process occurs when electrons and/or holes, moving across the space charge region, acquire sufficient energy from the electric field to create electron–hole pairs by colliding with atomic electrons within the depletion region. The avalanche process is schematically shown in Figure 7.12b. The newly
