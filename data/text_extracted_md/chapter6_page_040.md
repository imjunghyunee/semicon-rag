## Comment

This example shows that a surface recombination velocity of approximately \( s = 3 \times 10^4 \, \text{cm/s} \) could seriously degrade the performance of semiconductor devices, such as solar cells, since these devices tend to be fabricated close to a surface.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 6.10**  
(a) Using Equation (6.114), determine \(\delta p(x)\) for (i) \(s = \infty\) and (ii) \(s = 0\).  
(b) What does (i) an infinite surface recombination velocity \((s = \infty)\) and (ii) a zero surface recombination velocity \((s = 0)\) imply?

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{(i)} & \quad \delta p(x) \approx \delta p(0) \left( q \right) \cdot s_{0,L} = \left( x \delta q \right) \cdot \left( q \right) \cdot s_{0,L} = \left( x \delta q \right) \cdot \left( q \right) \cdot \left( \tau_{n,p} - 1 \right) \cdot s_{0,L} = \left( x \delta q \right) \cdot \left( q \right) \cdot \text{usv} \\
\end{align*}
\]

In the above example, the surface influences the excess carrier concentration to the extent that, even at a distance of \( L_p = 31.6 \, \mu \text{m} \) from the surface, the excess carrier concentration is only two-thirds of the value in the bulk. We will see in later chapters that device performance is dependent in large part on the properties of excess carriers.

## 6.7 | SUMMARY

- The processes of excess electron and hole generation and recombination were discussed. The excess carrier generation rate and recombination rate were defined.
- Excess electrons and holes do not move independently of each other, but move together. This common movement is called ambipolar transport.
- The ambipolar transport equation was derived and limits of low injection and extrinsic doping were applied to the coefficients. Under these conditions, the excess electrons and holes diffuse and drift together with the characteristics of the minority carrier, a result that is fundamental to the behavior of semiconductor devices.
- The concept of excess carrier lifetime was developed.
- Examples of excess carrier behavior as a function of time, as a function of space, and as a function of both time and space were examined.
- The quasi-Fermi level for electrons and the quasi-Fermi level for holes were defined. The degree of quasi-Fermi level splitting is a measure of departure from thermal equilibrium.
- The Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination was considered. Expressions for the excess minority carrier lifetime were developed. Generation and recombination of excess carriers increase as a result of traps in a semiconductor.
- The effect of a semiconductor surface influences the behavior of excess electrons and holes. The surface recombination velocity was defined.
