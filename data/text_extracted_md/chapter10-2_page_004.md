# CHAPTER 10 Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

**TYU 10.2** Consider an n⁺ polysilicon gate in a MOS structure with a p-type silicon substrate. The doping concentration of the silicon is \( N_a = 3 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Using Equation (10.16), find the value of \( \phi_{ms} \).

\[
(\lambda \, 9E6O = - \eta^{p} \, \text{suV})
\]

**TYU 10.3** Repeat TYU 10.2 for a p⁺ polysilicon gate using Equation (10.17).

\[
(\lambda \, 81^{0+} = - \eta^{p} \, \text{suV})
\]

**TYU 10.4** Consider the MOS capacitor described in Exercise TYU 10.3. The oxide thickness is \( t_{ox} = 16 \, \text{nm} = 160 \, \text{Å} \) and the oxide charge density is \( Q_{ox} = 8 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \). Determine the flat-band voltage.

\[
(\lambda \, \Sigma 1^{0+} \, \text{suV})
\]

**TYU 10.5** Consider an n⁺ polysilicon gate on silicon dioxide with a p-type silicon substrate doped to \( N_a = 3 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Assume \( Q_{ox} = 5 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \). Determine the required oxide thickness such that the threshold voltage is \( V_{TN} = +0.65 \, \text{V} \).

\[
(\gamma \, \zeta \Sigma = \omega \, \zeta \Sigma = \eta \, \text{suV})
\]

## 10.2 CAPACITANCE–VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS

As mentioned previously, the MOS capacitor structure is the heart of the MOSFET. A great deal of information about the MOS device and the oxide–semiconductor interface can be obtained from the capacitance versus voltage or C–V characteristics of the device. The capacitance of a device is defined as

\[
C = \frac{dQ}{dV}
\]

(10.34)

where \( dQ \) is the magnitude of the differential change in charge on one plate as a function of the differential change in voltage \( dV \) across the capacitor. The capacitance is a small-signal or ac parameter and is measured by superimposing a small ac voltage on an applied dc gate voltage. The capacitance, then, is measured as a function of the applied dc gate voltage.

### 10.2.1 Ideal C–V Characteristics

First we will consider the ideal C–V characteristics of the MOS capacitor and then discuss some of the deviations that occur from these idealized results. We will initially assume that there is zero charge trapped in the oxide and also that there is no charge trapped at the oxide–semiconductor interface.

There are three operating conditions of interest in the MOS capacitor: accumulation, depletion, and inversion. Figure 10.23a shows the energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for the case when a negative voltage is applied to the gate, inducing an accumulation layer of holes in the semiconductor at the oxide–semiconductor interface. A small differential change in voltage across the MOS structure will cause a differential change in charge on the metal gate and also in the hole accumulation charge, as shown in Figure 10.23b. The differential changes in charge density occur at the edges of the oxide, as in a parallel-plate capacitor. The
