A large curvature. The electric field in the depletion region tends to be concentrated at the curvature, which lowers the breakdown voltage. This curvature effect is shown in Figure 11.21.

## Near Avalanche and Snapback Breakdown

Another breakdown mechanism results in the S-shaped breakdown curve shown in Figure 11.22. This breakdown process is due to second order effects and can be explained with the aid of Figure 11.23. The n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET geometry in Figure 11.23a shows the
