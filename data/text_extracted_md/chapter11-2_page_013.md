# 11.5 Radiation and Hot-Electron Effects

## 11.5.1 Radiation and Hot-Electron Effects

We have considered the effects of fixed trapped oxide charge and interface state charge on the capacitance–voltage characteristics of MOS capacitors and on the MOSFET characteristics. These charges can exist because the oxide is essentially a perfect dielectric and a net charge density can exist in a dielectric material. Two processes that generate these charges are ionizing radiation and impact ionization in the drain region of a MOSFET operating near avalanche breakdown.

MOS devices are exposed to ionizing radiation, for example, in communication satellites orbiting through the Van Allen radiation belts. The ionizing radiation can produce additional fixed oxide charge and also additional interface states. In this short discussion of radiation effects in MOSFETs, we are concerned only with the permanent effects that occur in the device characteristics.

Another source can generate oxide charge and interface states: the hot electron effect. Electrons near the drain terminal of a MOSFET operating near avalanche breakdown can have energies that are much larger than the thermal-equilibrium value. These hot electrons have energies sufficient to penetrate the oxide–semiconductor barrier.

## 11.5.1 Radiation-Induced Oxide Charge

Gamma-rays or x-rays incident on semiconductor or oxide materials can interact with valence band electrons. The incident radiation photons can impart enough energy to a valence electron to elevate the electron into the conduction band; an empty state or hole is also produced in the valence band. This process generates electron–hole pairs. These newly generated electrons and holes can move through a material under the influence of an electric field.

Figure 11.30 shows the energy-band diagram of an MOS device with a p-type substrate and a positive gate voltage. The bandgap energy of silicon dioxide is approximately 9 eV.
