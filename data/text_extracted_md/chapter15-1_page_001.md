## Semiconductor Microwave and Power Devices

In previous chapters, we have discussed the basic physics, operation, and characteristics of diodes and transistors. We have analyzed the frequency response as well as the current–voltage characteristics of these semiconductor devices. However, we have not specifically considered the generation of microwave signals using semiconductor devices or the power capabilities of semiconductor transistors.

In this chapter, we first consider three semiconductor devices that are used to generate microwave signals. These devices include the tunnel diode, GUNN diode, and IMPATT diode. A basic principle of oscillators is that a region of negative differential resistance must exist. We consider the process by which a region of negative differential resistance is created in each device and discuss the basic operation of these devices.

Second, we discuss three specialized semiconductor power devices, including power bipolar transistors and power MOSFETs. We have considered the basic physics of these devices in previous chapters, and analyzed the current–voltage characteristics without specifically considering the current or voltage limitations or the power dissipation within the devices. In this chapter, we discuss the limitations in current and voltage, and the power capabilities of the devices. Finally, we discuss the operation and characteristics of a four-layered structure called a thyristor.

In this chapter, we will:

- Discuss the concept of negative differential resistance in a tunnel diode and derive an expression for the maximum resistance cutoff frequency.

- Discuss the concept of negative differential mobility in GaAs and discuss the process by which this characteristic can lead to microwave oscillations in a GUNN diode.

- Discuss the operation of an IMPATT diode oscillator and determine the process by which a dynamic negative resistance is created.
