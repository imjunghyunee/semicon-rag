The upper half of the semiconductor bandgap, then, since all the acceptor states are below \( E_F \) for the case shown in Figure 9.11b, these surface states will be negatively charged and will alter the energy-band diagram. Similarly, if we assume that donor surface states exist in the lower half of the bandgap, then all of the donor states will be positively charged for the case shown in Figure 9.13b; the positively charged surface states will also alter this energy-band diagram. Therefore, if \( \phi_m < \phi_b \) for the metal-n-type semiconductor contact, and if \( \phi_m > \phi_b \) for the metal-p-type semiconductor contact, we may not necessarily form a good ohmic contact.

## 9.2.2 Tunneling Barrier

The space charge width in a rectifying metal–semiconductor contact is inversely proportional to the square root of the semiconductor doping. The width of the depletion region decreases as the doping concentration in the semiconductor increases; thus, as the doping concentration increases, the probability of tunneling through the barrier increases. Figure 9.14 shows a junction in which the metal is in contact with a heavily doped n-type epitaxial layer.

**Objective:** Calculate the space charge width for a Schottky barrier on a heavily doped semiconductor.

**Example 9.7**

Consider silicon at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) doped at \( N_d = 7 \times 10^{18} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Assume a Schottky barrier with \( \phi_{bn} = 0.67 \, \text{V} \). For this case, we can assume that \( V_{bi} \approx \phi_{bn} \). Neglect the barrier lowering effect.

**Solution**

From Equation (9.7), we have for zero applied bias

\[
x_s = \left[ \frac{2 \varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{q N_d} \right]^{1/2} = \left[ \frac{2(11.7)(8.85 \times 10^{-14})(0.67)}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(7 \times 10^{18})} \right]^{1/2}
\]

or

\[
x_s = 1.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{cm} = 110 \, \text{Å}
\]
