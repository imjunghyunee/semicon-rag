The minority carrier diffusion current densities as a function of distance through the p and n regions. These results are

\[
J_{p}(x) = \frac{eD_{p}n_{0}}{L_{p}} \left[ \exp\left(\frac{eV_{a}}{kT}\right) - 1 \right] \exp\left(\frac{x_{n} - x}{L_{p}}\right) \quad (x \geq x_{n})

and

\[
J_{n}(x) = \frac{eD_{n}p_{0}}{L_{n}} \left[ \exp\left(\frac{eV_{a}}{kT}\right) - 1 \right] \exp\left(\frac{x_{p} + x}{L_{n}}\right) \quad (x \leq -x_{p})

The minority carrier diffusion current densities decay exponentially in each region. However, the total current through the pn junction is constant. The difference between total current and minority carrier diffusion current is a majority carrier current. Figure 8.10 shows the various current components through the pn structure. The drift of majority carrier holes in the p region far from the junction, for example, is to supply holes that are being injected across the space charge region into the n region and also to supply holes that are lost by recombination with excess minority carrier electrons. The same discussion applies to the drift of electrons in the n region.

We have seen that excess carriers are created in a forward-biased pn junction. From the results of the ambipolar transport theory derived in Chapter 6, the behavior of the excess carriers is determined by the minority carrier parameters for low injection. In determining the currentâ€“voltage relationship of the pn junction, we consider the flow of minority carriers since we know the behavior and characteristics of these particles. It may seem strange, at times, that we concern ourselves so much with minority carriers rather than with the vast number of majority carriers, but the reason for this can be found in the results derived from the ambipolar transport theory.
