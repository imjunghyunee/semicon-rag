**Figure 14.39** | Typical output power versus laser diode current at various temperatures.  
*(From Yang [22].)*

Typical optical output versus diode current characteristics are shown in Figure 14.39. The threshold current is defined to be the current at the breakpoint. At low currents, the output spectrum is very wide and is the result of the spontaneous transitions. When the diode current is slightly above the threshold value, the various resonant frequencies are observed. When the diode current becomes large, a single dominant mode with a narrow bandwidth is produced.

The performance of the laser diode can be further improved if a very narrow recombination region is used with a somewhat wider optical waveguide. Very complex structures using multilayers of compound semiconductor materials have been fabricated in a continuing effort to improve semiconductor laser performance.

## 14.7 | SUMMARY

- The absorption or emission of light (photons) in semiconductors leads to the study of a general class of devices called optoelectronics. A few of these devices have been discussed and analyzed in this chapter.
