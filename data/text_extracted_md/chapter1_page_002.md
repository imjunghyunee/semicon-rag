The elemental materials, those that are composed of single species of atoms, are silicon and germanium. Silicon is by far the most common semiconductor used in integrated circuits and will be emphasized to a great extent.

The two-element, or binary, compounds such as gallium arsenide or gallium phosphide are formed by combining one group III and one group V element. Gallium arsenide is one of the more common of the compound semiconductors. Its good optical properties make it useful in optical devices. GaAs is also used in specialized applications in which, for example, high speed is required.

We can also form a three-element, or ternary, compound semiconductor. An example is Al\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)As, in which the subscript \(x\) indicates the fraction of the lower atomic number element component. More complex semiconductors can also be formed that provide flexibility when choosing material properties.

## 1.2 | Types of Solids

Amorphous, polycrystalline, and single crystals are the three general types of solids. Each type is characterized by the size of an ordered region within the material. An ordered region is a spatial volume in which atoms or molecules have a regular geometric arrangement or periodicity. Amorphous materials have order only within a few atomic or molecular dimensions, while polycrystalline materials have a high degree of order over many atomic or molecular dimensions. These ordered regions, or single-crystal regions, vary in size and orientation with respect to one another. The single-crystal regions are called grains and are separated from one another by grain boundaries. Single-crystal materials, ideally, have a high degree of order, or regular geometric periodicity, throughout the entire volume of the material. The advantage of a single-crystal material is that, in general, its electrical properties are superior.
