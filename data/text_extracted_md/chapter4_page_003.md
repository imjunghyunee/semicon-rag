**Figure 4.1** (a) Density of states functions, Fermiâ€“Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole concentrations for the case when \( E_F \) is near the midgap energy; (b) expanded view near the conduction-band energy; and (c) expanded view near the valence-band energy.

### Description

- **(a)** 
  - \( g_c(E)f_r(E) = n(E) \)
  - Area = \( n_0 \) = electron concentration
  - \( f_r(E) = 0 \)
  - \( f_r(E) = 1 \)
  - \( g_v(E)[1 - f_r(E)] = p(E) \)
  - Area = \( p_0 \) = hole concentration

- **(b)**
  - \( f_r(E) \)
  - \( g_c(E) \)

- **(c)**
  - \( g_v(E) \)
  - \( [1 - f_r(E)] \)

### Text

In a semiconductor, then, **electrons and holes are created in pairs by the thermal energy so that the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band.**

Figure 4.1a shows a plot of the density of states function in the conduction-band \( g_c(E) \), the density of states function in the valence-band \( g_v(E) \), and the Fermi-Dirac probability function for \( T > 0 \) K when \( E_F \) is approximately halfway between \( E_c \) and \( E_v \). **If we assume, for the moment, that the electron and hole effective masses are equal, then \( g_c(E) \) and \( g_v(E) \) are symmetrical functions about the midgap energy (the energy midway between \( E_c \) and \( E_v \)).** We noted previously that the function \( f_r(E) \) for \( E > E_F \) is symmetrical to the function \( 1 - f_r(E) \) for \( E < E_F \) about the energy \( E = E_F \). This also means that the function \( f_r(E) \) for \( E = E_F + dE \) is equal to the function \( 1 - f_r(E) \) for \( E = E_F - dE \).
