### Comment

The applied gate voltage required to achieve the flat-band condition for this p-type substrate is negative. If the amount of fixed oxide charge increases, the flat-band voltage becomes even more negative.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 10.3** Repeat Example 10.3 for a doping concentration of \( N_a = 2 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), an oxide thickness of \( t_{ox} = 4 \, \text{nm} = 40 \, \text{Å} \), and \( Q'_{ox} = 2 \times 10^{10} \) electronic charges per cm\(^2\). What is the value of the metal–semiconductor work function difference?  
(\( \Lambda \text{TCO} \, I = \, 4 \, \text{Å} \, \Sigma 1 = \, \text{m} \Phi^0 \, \text{SUY} \))

## 10.1.6 Threshold Voltage

The threshold voltage is defined as the applied gate voltage required to achieve the threshold inversion point. The threshold inversion point, in turn, is defined as the condition when the surface potential is \( \phi_s = 2\phi_f \) for the p-type semiconductor and \( \phi_s = 2\phi_{fb} \) for the n-type semiconductor. These conditions are shown in Figures 10.9 and 10.10. The threshold voltage will be derived in terms of the electrical and geometrical properties of the MOS capacitor.

Figure 10.19 shows the charge distribution through the MOS device at the threshold inversion point for a p-type semiconductor substrate. The space charge width has reached its maximum value. We will assume that there is an equivalent oxide charge \( Q'_{ox} \) and the positive charge on the metal gate at threshold is \( Q'_{mT} \). The prime on the charge terms indicates charge per unit area. Even though we are assuming that the surface has been inverted, we will neglect the inversion layer charge at this threshold inversion point. From conservation of charge, we can write

\[
Q'_{mT} + Q'_{s} = |Q'_{SD}(max)|
\]

(10.26)

where

\[
|Q'_{SD}(max)| = eN_a x_{aT}
\]
