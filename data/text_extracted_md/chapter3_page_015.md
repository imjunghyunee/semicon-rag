# CHAPTER 3 Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

electron solution and the results of the single crystal shown in Figure 3.9, the parameter \(\hbar k\) in a single crystal is referred to as the crystal momentum. This parameter is not the actual momentum of the electron in the crystal but is a constant of the motion that includes the crystal interaction.

We have been considering the Kronig–Penney model, which is a one-dimensional periodic potential function used to model a single-crystal lattice. The principal result of this analysis, so far, is that electrons in the crystal occupy certain allowed energy bands and are excluded from the forbidden energy bands. For real three-dimensional single-crystal materials, a similar energy-band theory exists. We will obtain additional electron properties from the Kronig–Penney model in the next sections.

## 3.2 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS

Again, we are eventually interested in determining the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. We will need to consider electrical conduction in solids as it relates to the band theory we have just developed. Let us begin by considering the motion of electrons in the various allowed energy bands.

### 3.2.1 The Energy Band and the Bond Model

In Chapter 1, we discussed the covalent bonding of silicon. Figure 3.12 shows a two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in a single-crystal silicon lattice. This figure represents silicon at \(T = 0 \, K\) in which each silicon atom is surrounded by eight valence electrons that are in their lowest energy state and are directly involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 3.4b represented the splitting of the discrete silicon energy states into bands of allowed energies as the silicon crystal is formed. At \(T = 0 \, K\), the \(4N\) states in the lower band, the valence band, are filled with the valence electrons. All of the valence electrons schematically shown in Figure 3.12 are in the valence band. The upper energy band, the conduction band, is completely empty at \(T = 0 \, K\).

As the temperature increases above \(0 \, K\), a few valence band electrons may gain enough thermal energy to break the covalent bond and jump into the conduction band. Figure 3.13a shows a two-dimensional representation of this bond-breaking process.
