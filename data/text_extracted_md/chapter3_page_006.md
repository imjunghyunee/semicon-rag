## 3.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands

The upper band (the conduction band) will be empty. The bandgap energy \( E_g \) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band is the width of the forbidden energy band.

We have discussed qualitatively how and why bands of allowed and forbidden energies are formed in a crystal. The formation of these energy bands is directly related to the electrical characteristics of the crystal, as we will see later in our discussion.

### 3.1.2 The Kronig–Penney Model

In the previous section, we discussed qualitatively the splitting of allowed electron energies as atoms are brought together to form a crystal. The concept of allowed and forbidden energy bands can be developed more rigorously by considering quantum mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave equation. It may be easy for the reader to “get lost” in the following derivation, but the result forms the basis for the energy-band theory of semiconductors.

The potential function of a single, noninteracting, one-electron atom is shown in Figure 3.5a. Also indicated on the figure are the discrete energy levels allowed for the electron. Figure 3.5b shows the same type of potential function for the case when several atoms in close proximity are arranged in a one-dimensional array. The potential functions of adjacent atoms overlap, and the net potential function for this case is shown in Figure 3.5c. It is this potential function we would need to use in Schrödinger’s wave equation to model a one-dimensional single-crystal material.

The solution to Schrödinger’s wave equation, for this one-dimensional single-crystal lattice, is made more tractable by considering a simpler potential function. Figure 3.6 is the one-dimensional Kronig–Penney model of the periodic potential function, which is used to represent a one-dimensional single-crystal lattice. We need to solve Schrödinger’s wave equation in each region. As with previous quantum mechanical problems, the more interesting solution occurs for the case when \( E < V_0 \), which corresponds to a particle being bound within the crystal. The electrons are contained in the potential wells, but we have the possibility of tunneling between wells. The Kronig–Penney model is an idealized periodic potential representing a one-dimensional single crystal, but the results will illustrate many of the important features of the quantum behavior of electrons in a periodic lattice.

To obtain the solution to Schrödinger’s wave equation, we make use of a mathematical theorem by Bloch. The theorem states that all one-electron wave functions, for problems involving periodically varying potential energy functions, must be of the form

\[
\psi(x) = u(x)e^{j k x}
\]
