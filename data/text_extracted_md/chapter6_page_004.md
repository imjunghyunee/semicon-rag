# 6.1 Carrier Generation and Recombination

When excess electrons and holes are created, the concentration of electrons in the conduction band and of holes in the valence band increase above their thermal-equilibrium value. We may write

\[
n = n_0 + \delta n \tag{6.5a}
\]

and

\[
p = p_0 + \delta p \tag{6.5b}
\]

where \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) are the thermal-equilibrium concentrations, and \( \delta n \) and \( \delta p \) are the excess electron and hole concentrations. Figure 6.2 shows the excess electron–hole generation process and the resulting carrier concentrations. The external force has perturbed the equilibrium condition so that the semiconductor is no longer in thermal equilibrium. We may note from Equations (6.5a) and (6.5b) that, in a nonequilibrium condition, \( np \neq n_0p_0 = n_i^2 \).

A steady-state generation of excess electrons and holes will not cause a continual buildup of the carrier concentrations. As in the case of thermal equilibrium, an electron in the conduction band may “fall down” into the valence band, leading to the process of excess electron–hole recombination. Figure 6.3 shows this process. The
