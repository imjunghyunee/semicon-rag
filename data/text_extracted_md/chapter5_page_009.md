## Example 5.2

**Objective:** Determine the electron mobility in silicon at various doping concentrations and various temperatures.

Using Figure 5.2, find the electron mobility in silicon for:

(a) \( T = 25^\circ C \) for (i) \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and (ii) \( N_d = 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

(b) \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) for (i) \( T = 0^\circ C \) and (ii) \( T = 100^\circ C \).

### Solution:

From Figure 5.2, we find the following:

(a) \( T = 25^\circ C \):

- (i) \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) \(\Rightarrow \mu_n = 1200 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V-s}\).
- (ii) \( N_d = 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) \(\Rightarrow \mu_n = 800 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V-s}\).

(b) \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \):

- (i) \( T = 0^\circ C \) \(\Rightarrow \mu_n = 1400 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V-s}\).
- (ii) \( T = 100^\circ C \) \(\Rightarrow \mu_n = 780 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V-s}\).

### Comment

The results of this example show that the mobility values are strong functions of the doping concentration and temperature. These variations must be taken into account in the design of semiconductor devices.

### Exercise Problem

Ex 5.2 Using Figure 5.2, find the hole mobility in silicon for:

(a) \( T = 25^\circ C \) for (i) \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and (ii) \( N_d = 10^{18} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \), and

(b) \( N_d = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) for (i) \( T = 0^\circ C \) and (ii) \( T = 100^\circ C \).

## 5.1.3 Conductivity

The drift current density, given by Equation (5.9), may be written as

\[
J_{\text{dr}} = e(\mu_n n + \mu_p p)E = \sigma E
\]

(5.19)

where \(\sigma\) is the conductivity of the semiconductor material. The conductivity is given in units of \((\Omega\cdot\text{cm})^{-1}\) and is a function of the electron and hole concentrations and mobilities. We have just seen that the mobilities are functions of impurity concentrations; conductivity, then is a somewhat complicated function of impurity concentration.

The reciprocal of conductivity is **resistivity**, which is denoted by \(\rho\) and is given in units of ohm-cm. We can write the formula for resistivity as

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma} = \frac{1}{e(\mu_n n + \mu_p p)}
\]

(5.20)

Figure 5.4 is a plot of resistivity as a function of impurity concentration in silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, and gallium phosphide at \( T = 300 \, K \). Obviously, the curves are not linear functions of \( N_d \) or \( N_a \) because of mobility effects.

*The symbol \(\rho\) is also used for volume charge density. The context in which \(\rho\) is used should make it clear whether it stands for charge density or resistivity.*
