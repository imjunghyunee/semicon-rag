# 14.6.4 Device Structures and Characteristics

We have seen that in a homojunction LED, the photons may be emitted in any direction, which lowers the external quantum efficiency. Significant improvement in device characteristics can be made if the emitted photons are confined to a region near the junction. This confinement can be achieved by using an optical dielectric waveguide. The basic device is a three-layered, double heterojunction structure known as a double heterojunction laser. A requirement for a dielectric waveguide is that the index of refraction of the center material be larger than that of the other two dielectrics. Figure 14.37 shows the index of refraction for the AlGaAs system. We may note that GaAs has the highest index of refraction.

An example of a double heterojunction laser is shown in Figure 14.38a. A thin p-GaAs layer is between P-AlGaAs and N-AlGaAs layers. A simplified energy-band diagram is shown in Figure 14.38b for the forward-biased diode. Electrons are injected from the N-AlGaAs into the p-GaAs. Population inversion is easily obtained since the conduction band potential barrier prevents the electrons from diffusing into the P-AlGaAs region. Radiative recombination is then confined to the p-GaAs region. Since the index of refraction of GaAs is larger than that of AlGaAs, the light wave is also confined to the GaAs region. An optical cavity can be formed by cleaving the semiconductor perpendicular to the N-AlGaAsâ€“p-GaAs junction.
