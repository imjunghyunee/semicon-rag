**Figure 5.11** (a) Diffusion of electrons due to a density gradient. (b) Diffusion of holes due to a density gradient.

We may write the electron diffusion current density for this one-dimensional case, in the form

\[
J_{\text{n-diff}} = eD_n \frac{dn}{dx}
\]

(5.33)

where \( D_n \) is called the **electron diffusion coefficient**, has units of cm\(^2\)/s, and is a positive quantity. If the electron density gradient becomes negative, the electron diffusion current density will be in the negative \( x \) direction.

Figure 5.11b shows an example of a hole concentration as a function of distance in a semiconductor. The diffusion of holes, from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, produces a flux of holes in the negative \( x \) direction. Since holes are positively charged particles, the conventional diffusion current density is also in the negative \( x \) direction. The hole diffusion current density is proportional to the hole density gradient and to the electronic charge, so we may write

\[
J_{\text{p-diff}} = -eD_p \frac{dp}{dx}
\]

(5.34)

for the one-dimensional case. The parameter \( D_p \) is called the **hole diffusion coefficient**, has units of cm\(^2\)/s, and is a positive quantity. If the hole density gradient becomes negative, the hole diffusion current density will be in the positive \( x \) direction.
