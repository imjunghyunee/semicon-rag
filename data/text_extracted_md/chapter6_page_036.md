# 6.6 Surface Effects

## 6.6.1 Surface States

In all previous discussions, we have implicitly assumed the semiconductors were infinite in extent; thus, we were not concerned with any boundary conditions at a semiconductor surface. In any real application of semiconductors, the material is not infinitely large and therefore surfaces do exist between the semiconductor and an adjacent medium.

When a semiconductor is abruptly terminated, the perfect periodic nature of the idealized single-crystal lattice ends abruptly at the surface. The disruption of the periodic-potential function results in allowed electronic energy states within the energy bandgap. In the previous section, we argued that simple defects in the semiconductor would create discrete energy states within the bandgap. The abrupt termination of the periodic potential at the surface results in a distribution of allowed energy states within the bandgap, shown schematically in Figure 6.17 along with the discrete energy states in the bulk semiconductor.

The Shockley–Read–Hall recombination theory shows that the excess minority carrier lifetime is inversely proportional to the density of trap states. We may argue that since the density of traps at the surface is larger than in the bulk, the excess minority carrier lifetime at the surface will be smaller than the corresponding lifetime in the bulk material. If we consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor, for example, the recombination rate of excess carriers in the bulk, given by Equation (6.102), is

\[
R = \frac{\delta p}{\tau_{p0}} = \frac{\delta p_B}{\tau_{p0}}
\]

(6.106)

where \(\delta p_B\) is the concentration of excess minority carrier holes in the bulk material. We may write a similar expression for the recombination rate of excess carriers at the surface as

\[
R_s = \frac{\delta p_s}{\tau_{ps}}
\]

(6.107)

where \(\delta p_s\) is the excess minority carrier hole concentration at the surface and \(\tau_{ps}\) is the excess minority carrier hole lifetime at the surface.
