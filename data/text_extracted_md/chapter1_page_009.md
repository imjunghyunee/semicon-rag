# 1.3 Space Lattices

cuts the center atom and the corner atoms, so the entire center atom is included in the number of atoms in the crystal plane. The lattice plane in Figure 1.9b, then, contains two atoms.

## Solution

The number of atoms per lattice plane is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 4 + 1 = 2 \).

The surface density of atoms is then found as

\[
\text{Surface Density} = \frac{\# \text{of atoms per lattice plane}}{\text{area of lattice plane}}
\]

So

\[
\text{Surface Density} = \frac{2}{(a)(a\sqrt{2})} = \frac{2}{(5 \times 10^{-8})^2\sqrt{2}} = 5.66 \times 10^{14} \text{ atoms/cm}^2
\]

## Comment

The surface density of atoms is a function of the particular crystal plane in the lattice and generally varies from one crystal plane to another.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 1.3** The lattice constant of a face-centered-cubic structure is 4.25 Å. Calculate the surface density of atoms for a (a) (100) plane and (b) (110) plane.

\[
[\text{L: } u=0, v=0] \times [\text{S: } a \times L (Q) - \text{L: } u=0, v=0] \times [1 \ 1 \ 1 \ (\text{b}) \ \text{SVU}]
\]

## 1.3.4 Directions in Crystals

In addition to describing crystal planes in a lattice, we may want to describe a particular direction in the crystal. The direction can be expressed as a set of three integers that are the components of a vector in that direction. For example, the body diagonal in a simple cubic lattice is composed of vector components 1, 1, 1. The body diagonal is then described as the [111] direction. The brackets are used to designate direction as distinct from the parentheses used for the crystal plane. The three basic directions and the associated crystal planes for the simple cubic structure are shown in Figure 1.10. Note that in the simple cubic lattices, the [hkl] direction is perpendicular to the (hkl) plane. This perpendicularity may not be true in noncubic lattices.
