**Figure 9.6** | Energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor junction with an interfacial layer and interface states.

The surface potential \( \phi_0 \) are donor states, which will be neutral if the state contains an electron and positively charged if the state does not contain an electron. We also assume that all states above \( \phi_0 \) are acceptor states, which will be neutral if the state does not contain an electron and negatively charged if the state contains an electron.

The diagram in Figure 9.6 shows some acceptor states above \( \phi_0 \) and below \( E_F \). These states tend to contain electrons and are negatively charged. We may assume that the surface state density is constant and equal to \( D_s \) states/cm\(^2\)-eV. The relation between the surface potential, surface state density, and other semiconductor parameters is found to be

\[
(E_s - e\phi_0 - e\phi_{bn}) = \frac{1}{eD_{it}} \sqrt{2\epsilon_s N_d(\phi_{bn} - \phi_s)} - \frac{\epsilon_i}{eD_s \delta} [\phi_m - (\chi + \phi_{bn})]
\]

(9.16)

We consider two limiting cases.

**Case 1**  
Let \( D_s \rightarrow \infty \). In this case, the right side of Equation (9.16) goes to zero. We then have

\[
\phi_{bn} = \frac{1}{e} (E_s - e\phi_0)
\]

(9.17)

The barrier height is now fixed by the bandgap energy and the potential \( \phi_0 \). The barrier height is totally independent of the metal work function and the semiconductor electron affinity. The Fermi level becomes “pinned” at the surface, at the surface potential \( \phi_0 \).

**Case 2**  
Let \( D_s \delta \rightarrow 0 \). Equation (9.16) reduces to

\[
\phi_{bn} = (\phi_m - \chi)
\]

which is the original ideal expression.

The Schottky barrier height is a function of the electric field in the semiconductor through the barrier lowering effect. The barrier height is also a function of the surface states in the semiconductor. The barrier height, then, is modified from the ideal theoretical value. Since the surface state density is not predictable with any degree of certainty, the barrier height must be an experimentally determined parameter.
