!Figure 3.7  
*Figure 3.7 | The parabolic \( E \) versus \( k \) curve for the free electron.*

Since the potential is equal to zero, the total energy \( E \) is equal to the kinetic energy, so that, from Equation (3.5), Equation (3.26) may be written as

\[
\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2m\left(\frac{mv^2}{2}\right)}{\hbar^2}} = \frac{p}{\hbar} = k
\]

(3.27)

where \( p \) is the particle momentum. The constant of the motion parameter \( k \) is related to the particle momentum for the free electron. The parameter \( k \) is also referred to as a wave number.

We can also relate the energy and momentum as

\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{k^2\hbar^2}{2m}
\]

(3.28)

Figure 3.7 shows the parabolic relation of Equation (3.28) between the energy \( E \) and momentum \( p \) for the free particle. Since the momentum and wave number are linearly related, Figure 3.7 is also the \( E \) versus \( k \) curve for the particle.

We now want to consider the relation between \( E \) and \( k \) from Equation (3.24) for the particle in the single-crystal lattice. As the parameter \( P' \) increases, the particle becomes more tightly bound to the potential well or atom. We may define the left side of Equation (3.24) to be a function \( f(\alpha a) \), so that

\[
f(\alpha a) = P' \frac{\sin \alpha a}{\alpha a} + \cos \alpha a
\]

(3.29)

Figure 3.8a is a plot of the first term of Equation (3.29) versus \( \alpha a \). Figure 3.8b shows a plot of the \( \cos \alpha a \) term and Figure 3.8c is the sum of the two terms, or \( f(\alpha a) \).

Now from Equation (3.24), we also have that

\[
f(\alpha a) = \cos ka
\]

(3.30)

For Equation (3.30) to be valid, the allowed values of the \( f(\alpha a) \) function must be bounded between \( +1 \) and \( -1 \). Figure 3.8c shows the allowed values of \( f(\alpha a) \) and the allowed values of \( \alpha a \) in the shaded areas. Also shown on the figure are the values of \( ka \) from the right side of Equation (3.30), which correspond to the allowed values of \( f(\alpha a) \).
