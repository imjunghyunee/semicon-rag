# 12.3 Transistor Currents and Low-Frequency Common-Base Current Gain

The basic principle of operation of the bipolar transistor is the control of the collector current by the B–E voltage. The collector current is a function of the number of majority carriers reaching the collector after being injected from the emitter across the B–E junction. The **common-base current gain** is defined as the ratio of collector current to emitter current. The flow of various charged carriers leads to definitions of particular currents in the device. We can use these definitions to define the current gain of the transistor in terms of several factors.

## 12.3.1 Current Gain—Contributing Factors

Figure 12.18 shows the various particle flux components in the npn bipolar transistor. We define the various flux components and then consider the resulting currents. Although there seems to be a large number of flux components, we may help clarify the situation by correlating each factor with the minority carrier distributions shown in Figure 12.14.

The factor \( J_{E}^{n} \) is the electron flux injected from the emitter into the base. As the electrons diffuse across the base, a few will recombine with majority carrier holes. The majority carrier holes that are lost by recombination must be replenished from the base terminal. This replacement hole flux is denoted by \( J_{B}^{R} \). The electron flux that reaches the collector is \( J_{C}^{n} \). The majority carrier holes from the base that are injected back into the emitter result in a hole flux denoted by \( J_{E}^{p} \). Some electrons and holes
