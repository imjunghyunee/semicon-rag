### 8.1.3 Boundary Conditions

Figure 8.2 shows the conduction-band energy through the pn junction in thermal equilibrium. The n region contains many more electrons in the conduction band than the p region; the built-in potential barrier prevents this large density of electrons from flowing into the p region. The built-in potential barrier maintains equilibrium between the carrier distributions on either side of the junction.

An expression for the built-in potential barrier was derived in the last chapter and was given by Equation (7.10) as

\[
V_{bi} = V_t \ln \left( \frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} \right)
\]
