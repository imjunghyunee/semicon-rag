# CHAPTER 1 The Crystal Structure of Solids

first two, the valence electrons can also interact and continue to form a bond. Solid sodium has a body-centered cubic structure, so each atom has eight nearest neighbors with each atom sharing many valence electrons. We may think of the positive metallic ions as being surrounded by a sea of negative electrons, the solid being held together by the electrostatic forces. This description gives a qualitative picture of the metallic bond.

A fourth type of atomic bond, called the Van der Waals bond, is the weakest of the chemical bonds. A hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule, for example, is formed by an ionic bond. The effective center of the positive charge of the molecule is not the same as the effective center of the negative charge. This nonsymmetry in the charge distribution results in a small electric dipole that can interact with the dipoles of other HF molecules. With these weak interactions, solids formed by the Van der Waals bonds have a relatively low melting temperatureâ€”in fact, most of these materials are in gaseous form at room temperature.

## *1.6 IMPERFECTIONS AND IMPURITIES IN SOLIDS

Up to this point, we have been considering an ideal single-crystal structure. In a real crystal, the lattice is not perfect, but contains imperfections or defects; that is, the perfect geometric periodicity is disrupted in some manner. Imperfections tend to alter the electrical properties of a material and, in some cases, electrical parameters can be dominated by these defects or impurities.

### 1.6.1 Imperfections in Solids

One type of imperfection that all crystals have in common is atomic thermal vibration. A perfect single crystal contains atoms at particular lattice sites, the atoms separated from each other by a distance we have assumed to be constant. The atoms in a crystal, however, have a certain thermal energy, which is a function of temperature. The thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate in a random manner about an equilibrium lattice point. This random thermal motion causes the distance between atoms to randomly fluctuate, slightly disrupting the perfect geometric arrangement of atoms. This imperfection, called lattice vibrations, affects some electrical parameters, as we will see later in our discussion of semiconductor material characteristics.

Another type of defect is called a point defect. There are several of this type that we need to consider. Again, in an ideal single-crystal lattice, the atoms are arranged in a perfect periodic arrangement. However, in a real crystal, an atom may be missing from a particular lattice site. This defect is referred to as a vacancy; it is schematically shown in Figure 1.18a. In another situation, an atom may be located between lattice sites. This defect is referred to as an interstitial and is schematically shown in Figure 1.18b. In the case of vacancy and interstitial defects, not only is the perfect
