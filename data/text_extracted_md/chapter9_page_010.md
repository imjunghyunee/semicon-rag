# CHAPTER 9 Metal–Semiconductor and Semiconductor Heterojunctions

**Comment**

Although the Schottky barrier lowering may seem like a small value, the barrier height and the barrier lowering will appear in exponential terms in the current–voltage relationship. A small change in the barrier height can thus have a significant effect on the current in a Schottky barrier diode.

## EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 9.3** Consider the Schottky diode described in Example 9.1. Calculate the Schottky barrier lowering for a reverse-biased voltage of (a) \( V_R = 1 \, \text{V} \) and (b) \( V_R = 5 \, \text{V} \).

\[
\Delta \phi = \phi (a) : \Delta \phi = \phi (b) : \text{suV}
\]

## Interface States

Figure 9.5 shows the measured barrier heights in gallium arsenide and silicon Schottky diodes as a function of metal work functions. There is a monotonic relation between the measured barrier height and the metal work function, but the curves do not fit the simple relation given in Equation (9.1). The barrier height of the metal–semiconductor junction is determined by both the metal work function and the semiconductor surface or interface states.

A more detailed energy-band diagram of a metal to n-type semiconductor contact in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 9.6. We assume that a narrow interfacial layer of insulator exists between the metal and semiconductor. The interfacial layer can support a potential difference, but will be transparent to the flow of electrons between the metal and semiconductor. The semiconductor also shows a distribution of surface states at the metal–semiconductor interface. We assume that all states below
