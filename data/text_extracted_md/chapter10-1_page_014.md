### Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

Diagram for the case of a p⁺ polysilicon gate and the p-type silicon substrate. In the degenerately doped polysilicon, we will initially assume that \( E_F = E_c \) for the n⁺ case and \( E_F = E_v \) for the p⁺ case.

For the n⁺ polysilicon gate, the metal–semiconductor work function difference can be written as

\[
\phi_{ms} = \left[ \chi' - \left( \frac{E_t}{2e} + \phi_p \right) \right] = - \left( \frac{E_t}{2e} + \phi_p \right)
\]

(10.16)

and for the p⁺ polysilicon gate, we have

\[
\phi_{ms} = \left[ \left( \chi' + \frac{E_t}{e} \right) - \left( \frac{E_t}{2e} + \phi_p \right) \right] = \left( \frac{E_t}{2e} - \phi_p \right)
\]

(10.17)

However, for degenerately doped n⁺ polysilicon and p⁺ polysilicon, the Fermi level can be above \( E_c \) and below \( E_v \), respectively, by 0.1 to 0.2 V. The experimental \( \phi_{ms} \) values will then be slightly different from the values calculated by using Equations (10.16) and (10.17).

We have been considering a p-type semiconductor substrate. We may also have an n-type semiconductor substrate in a MOS capacitor. Figure 10.15 shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor with a metal gate and the n-type semiconductor substrate, for the case when a negative voltage is applied to the gate. The metal–semiconductor work function difference for this case is defined as

\[
\phi_{ms} = \phi'_m - \left( \chi' + \frac{E_t}{2e} - \phi_n \right)
\]
