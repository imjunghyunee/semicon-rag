The output of a GaAs LED is not in the visible range. For a visible output, the wavelength of the signal should be in the range of 0.4 to 0.72 Î¼m. This range of wavelengths corresponds to bandgap energies between approximately 1.7 and 3.1 eV.

GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) is a direct bandgap material for \(0 \leq x \leq 0.45\), as shown in Figure 14.24. At \(x = 0.40\), the bandgap energy is approximately \(E_g = 1.9\) eV, which would produce an optical output in the red range. Figure 14.29 shows the brightness of GaAs\(_{1-x}\)P\(_x\) diodes for different values of \(x\). The peak also occurs in the red range. By using planar technology, GaAs\(_{0.6}\)P\(_{0.4}\) monolithic arrays have been fabricated for numeric and alphanumeric displays. When the mole fraction \(x\) is greater than 0.45, the material changes to an indirect bandgap semiconductor so that the quantum efficiency is greatly reduced.

GaAlAs\(_{1-x}\) can be used in a heterojunction structure to form an LED. A device structure is shown in Figure 14.30. Electrons are injected from the wide-bandgap \(N\)-GaAl\(_{0.3}\)As\(_{0.7}\) into the narrow-bandgap \(p\)-GaAl\(_{0.6}\)As\(_{0.4}\). The minority carrier electrons
