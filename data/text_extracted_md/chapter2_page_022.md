and finally

\[ T = 3.17 \times 10^{-6} \]

**Comment**

The tunneling probability may appear to be a small value, but the value is not zero. If a large number of particles impinge on a potential barrier, a significant number can penetrate the barrier.

## Exercise Problem

**Ex 2.5** (a) Estimate the probability of an electron with energy \( E = 0.12 \, \text{eV} \) tunneling through a rectangular potential barrier with a height of \( V_0 = 1.2 \, \text{eV} \) and a width of \( a = 5 \, \text{Å} \). (b) Repeat part (a) for a barrier width of \( a = 25 \, \text{Å} \).

\[ [\cdot 01 \times 6L = L (q) \cdot 01 \times 6L = L (q) \cdot 01 \times 20L = L (q) \cdot sUV] \]

Additional applications of Schrödinger’s wave equation with various one-dimensional potential functions are found in problems at the end of the chapter. Several of these potential functions represent quantum well structures that are found in modern semiconductor devices.

## Test Your Understanding

**TYU 2.3** (a) Estimate the probability of an electron with energy \( E = 0.10 \, \text{eV} \) tunneling through a rectangular potential barrier with a barrier height of \( V_0 = 0.8 \, \text{eV} \) and width \( a = 12 \, \text{Å} \). (b) Repeat part (a) for a barrier height of \( V_0 = 1.5 \, \text{eV} \).

\[ [\cdot 01 \times 6L = L (q) \cdot 01 \times 6L = L (q) \cdot sUV] \]

**TYU 2.4** A certain semiconductor device requires a tunneling probability of \( T = 5 \times 10^{-6} \) for an electron tunneling through a rectangular barrier with a barrier height of \( V_0 = 0.8 \, \text{eV} \). The electron energy is \( E = 0.08 \, \text{eV} \). Determine the maximum barrier width.

\[ (Y 9Y = L = D \cdot sUV) \]

## 2.4 Extensions of the Wave Theory to Atoms

So far in this chapter, we have considered several one-dimensional potential energy functions and solved Schrödinger’s time-independent wave equation to obtain the probability function of finding a particle at various positions. Consider now the one-electron, or hydrogen, atom potential function. We will only briefly consider the mathematical details and wave function solutions, but the results are interesting and important.

### 2.4.1 The One-Electron Atom

The nucleus is a heavy, positively charged proton and the electron is a light, negatively charged particle that, in the classical Bohr theory, is revolving around the nucleus. 

*The detailed mathematical analysis is beyond the scope of this text, but the results, which are emphasized in this section, are important in the following discussions of semiconductor physics.*
