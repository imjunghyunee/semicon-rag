pulled by the lead car. So there is a “splitting” of power (energy) of the two interacting race cars. (Keep in mind not to take analogies too literally.)

Now, if we somehow start with a regular periodic arrangement of hydrogen-type atoms that are initially very far apart, and begin pushing the atoms together, the initial quantized energy level will split into a band of discrete energy levels. This effect is shown schematically in Figure 3.2, where the parameter \( r_0 \) represents the equilibrium interatomic distance in the crystal. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, there is a band of allowed energies, but within the allowed band, the energies are at discrete levels. The Pauli exclusion principle states that the joining of atoms to form a system (crystal) does not alter the total number of quantum states regardless of size. However, since no two electrons can have the same quantum number, the discrete energy must split into a band of energies in order that each electron can occupy a distinct quantum state.

We have seen previously that, at any energy level, the number of allowed quantum states is relatively small. In order to accommodate all of the electrons in a crystal, we must have many energy levels within the allowed band. As an example, suppose that we have a system with \( 10^9 \) one-electron atoms and also suppose that, at the equilibrium interatomic distance, the width of the allowed energy band is 1 eV. For simplicity, we assume that each electron in the system occupies a different energy level and, if the discrete energy states are equidistant, then the energy levels are separated by \( 10^{-9} \) eV. This energy difference is extremely small, so that for all practical purposes, we have a quasi-continuous energy distribution through the allowed energy band. The fact that \( 10^{-9} \) eV is a very small difference between two energy states can be seen from the following example.

## Example 3.1

**Objective:** Calculate the change in kinetic energy of an electron when the velocity changes by a small amount.

Consider an electron traveling at a velocity of \( 10^7 \) cm/s. Assume that the velocity increases by a value of 1 cm/s. The increase in kinetic energy is given by

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (v_2^2 - v_1^2)
\]

Let \( v_2 = v_1 + \Delta v \). Then

\[
v_2^2 = (v_1 + \Delta v)^2 = v_1^2 + 2v_1 \Delta v + (\Delta v)^2
\]
