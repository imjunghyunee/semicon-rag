# Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Solids

Forces are related to the viscosity of the liquids. Because of the difference in motion of the marble in these two cases, the mass of the marble would appear to be different in water than in oil. (As with any analogy, we must be careful not to be too literal.)

We can also relate the effective mass of an electron in a crystal to the \( E \) versus \( k \) curves, such as is shown in Figure 3.11. In a semiconductor material, we will be dealing with allowed energy bands that are almost empty of electrons and other energy bands that are almost full of electrons.

To begin, consider the case of a free electron whose \( E \) versus \( k \) curve is shown in Figure 3.7. Recalling Equation (3.28), the energy and momentum are related by

\[
E = p^2/2m = \hbar^2 k^2/2m
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron. The momentum and wave number \( k \) are related by \( p = \hbar k \). If we take the derivative of Equation (3.28) with respect to \( k \), we obtain

\[
\frac{dE}{dk} = \frac{\hbar^2 k}{m} = \frac{\hbar p}{m}
\]

Relating momentum to velocity, Equation (3.38) can be written as

\[
\frac{1}{\hbar} \frac{dE}{dk} = \frac{p}{m} = v
\]

(3.39)

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle. The first derivative of \( E \) with respect to \( k \) is related to the velocity of the particle.

If we now take the second derivative of \( E \) with respect to \( k \), we have

\[
\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{m}
\]

(3.40)

We may rewrite Equation (3.40) as

\[
\frac{1}{\hbar} \frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \frac{1}{m}
\]

(3.41)

The second derivative of \( E \) with respect to \( k \) is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle. For the case of a free electron, the mass is a constant (nonrelativistic effect), so the second derivative function is a constant. We may also note from Figure 3.7 that \( d^2E/dk^2 \) is a positive quantity, which implies that the mass of the electron is also a positive quantity.

If we apply an electric field to the free electron and use Newtonâ€™s classical equation of motion, we can write

\[
F = ma = -eE
\]

(3.42)

where \( a \) is the acceleration, \( E \) is the applied electric field, and \( e \) is the magnitude of the electronic charge. Solving for the acceleration, we have

\[
a = -\frac{eE}{m}
\]

(3.43)

The motion of the free electron is in the opposite direction to the applied electric field because of the negative charge.

We may now apply the results to the electron in the bottom of an allowed energy band. Consider the allowed energy band in Figure 3.16a. The energy near the bottom...
