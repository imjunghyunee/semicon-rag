Combining Equations (5.46a) and (5.46b) gives

\[
\frac{D_n}{\mu_n} = \frac{D_p}{\mu_p} = \frac{kT}{e}
\]

(5.47)

The diffusion coefficient and mobility are not independent parameters. This relation between the mobility and diffusion coefficient, given by Equation (5.47), is known as the **Einstein relation**.

----

### Objective: Determine the diffusion coefficient given the carrier mobility.

Assume that the mobility of a particular carrier is 1000 cm\(^2\)/V·s at \( T = 300 \) K.

**Solution**

Using the Einstein relation, we have that

\[
D = \left( \frac{kT}{e} \right) \mu = (0.0259)(1000) = 25.9 \text{ cm}^2/\text{s}
\]

**Comment**

Although this example is fairly simple and straightforward, it is important to keep in mind the relative orders of magnitude of the mobility and diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient is approximately 40 times smaller than the mobility at room temperature.

**EXERCISE PROBLEM**

Ex. 5.7 Assume the electron diffusion coefficient of a semiconductor at \( T = 300 \) K is \( D_n = 215 \) cm\(^2\)/s. Determine the electron mobility. (S·N·ω3 10E8 = *ηf s·νv*)

Table 5.2 shows the diffusion coefficient values at \( T = 300 \) K corresponding to the mobilities listed in Table 5.1 for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium.

The relation between the mobility and diffusion coefficient given by Equation (5.47) contains temperature. It is important to keep in mind that the major temperature effects are a result of lattice scattering and ionized impurity scattering processes, as discussed in Section 5.1.2. As the mobilities are strong functions of temperature because of the scattering processes, the diffusion coefficients are also strong functions of temperature. The specific temperature dependence given in Equation (5.47) is a small fraction of the real temperature characteristic.
