# 12.2.2 Other Modes of Operation

The bipolar transistor can also operate in the cutoff, saturation, or inverse-active mode. We qualitatively discuss the minority carrier distributions for these operating conditions and treat the actual calculations as problems at the end of the chapter.

Figure 12.16a shows the minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor in cutoff. In cutoff, both the B–E and B–C junctions are reverse biased; thus, the minority carrier concentrations are zero at each space charge edge. The emitter and collector regions are assumed to be “long” in this figure, while the base is narrow compared with the minority carrier diffusion length. Since \( x_B \ll L_B \), essentially all minority carriers are swept out of the base region.

Figure 12.16b shows the minority carrier distribution in the npn bipolar transistor operating in saturation. Both the B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased; thus, excess minority carriers exist at the edge of each space charge region. However, since a collector current still exists when the transistor is in saturation, a gradient will still exist in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base.

Finally, Figure 12.17a shows the minority carrier distribution in the npn transistor for the inverse-active mode. In this case, the B–E is reverse biased and the B–C is forward biased. Electrons from the collector are now injected into the base. The gradient in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is in the opposite direction.
