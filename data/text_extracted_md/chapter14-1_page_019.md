**Figure 14.17** (a) A reverse-biased pn junction. (b) Minority carrier concentration in the reverse-biased pn junction.

Uniformly throughout the semiconductor device. Figure 14.17a shows the reverse-biased diode and Figure 14.17b shows the minority carrier distribution in the reverse-biased junction prior to photon illumination.

Let \( G_L \) be the generation rate of excess carriers. The excess carriers generated within the space charge region are swept out of the depletion region very quickly by the electric field; the electrons are swept into the n region and the holes into the p region. The photon-generated current density from the space charge region is given by

\[
J_{L1} = e \int G_L \, dx
\]

(14.27)

where the integral is over the space charge region width. If \( G_L \) is constant throughout the space charge volume, then

\[
J_{L1} = e G_L W
\]

(14.28)

where \( W \) is the space charge width. We may note that \( J_{L1} \) is in the reverse-biased direction through the pn junction. This component of photocurrent responds very quickly to the photon illumination and is known as the prompt photocurrent.

We may note, by comparing Equations (14.28) and (14.25), that the photodiode gain is unity. The speed of the photodiode is limited by the carrier transport through the junction.
