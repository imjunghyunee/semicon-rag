# Chapter 6: Nonequilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

If we apply the conditions of an extrinsic p-type semiconductor and low injection to the ambipolar mobility, Equation (6.41) reduces to

\[
\mu' = \mu_n
\]

(6.46)

It is important to note that for an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and the ambipolar mobility coefficient reduce to the minority carrier electron parameter values, which are constants. The ambipolar transport equation reduces to a linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

If we now consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, we may assume that \( p_0 \ll n_0 \) and \( \delta n \ll n_0 \). The ambipolar diffusion coefficient from Equation (6.43) reduces to

\[
D' = D_p
\]

(6.47)

and the ambipolar mobility from Equation (6.41) reduces to

\[
\mu' = -\mu_p
\]

(6.48)

The ambipolar parameters again reduce to the minority-carrier values, which are constants. Note that, for the n-type semiconductor, the ambipolar mobility is a negative value. The ambipolar mobility term is associated with carrier drift; therefore, the sign of the drift term depends on the charge of the particle. The equivalent ambipolar particle is negatively charged, as one can see by comparing Equations (6.30) and (6.39). If the ambipolar mobility reduces to that of a positively charged hole, a negative sign is introduced as shown in Equation (6.48).

The remaining terms we need to consider in the ambipolar transport equation are the generation rate and the recombination rate. Recall that the electron and hole recombination rates are equal and are given by Equation (6.35) as \( R_n = R_p = n/\tau_n = p/\tau_p = R \), where \( \tau_n \) and \( \tau_p \) are the mean electron and hole lifetimes, respectively. If we consider the inverse lifetime functions, then \( 1/\tau_n \) is the probability per unit time that an electron will encounter a hole and recombine. Likewise, \( 1/\tau_p \) is the probability per unit time that a hole will encounter an electron and recombine. If we again consider an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the concentration of majority carrier holes will be essentially constant, even when excess carriers are present. Then, the probability per unit time of a minority carrier electron encountering a majority carrier hole will be essentially constant. Hence, the minority carrier electron lifetime, \( \tau_n = \tau_p \), will remain a constant for the extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection.

Similarly, if we consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, the minority carrier hole lifetime, \( \tau_p = \tau_n \), will remain constant. Even under the condition of low injection, the minority carrier hole concentration may increase by several orders of magnitude. The probability per unit time of a minority carrier electron encountering a hole may change drastically. The majority carrier lifetime, then, may change substantially when excess carriers are present.

Consider, again, the generation and recombination terms in the ambipolar transport equation. For electrons we may write

\[
g - R = g_n - R_n = (G_{n0} + g'_n) - (R_{n0} + R'_n)
\]
