# 1.3.3 Crystal Planes and Miller Indices

Since real crystals are not infinitely large, they eventually terminate at a surface. Semiconductor devices are fabricated at or near a surface, so the surface properties may influence the device characteristics. We would like to be able to describe these surfaces in terms of the lattice. Surfaces, or planes through the crystal, can be described by first considering the intercepts of the plane along the \( \bar{a}, \bar{b}, \) and \( \bar{c} \) axes used to describe the lattice.

## Example 1.2

**Objective:** Describe the plane shown in Figure 1.6. (The lattice points in Figure 1.6 are shown along the \( \bar{a}, \bar{b}, \) and \( \bar{c} \) axes only.)

*Figure 1.6 | A representative crystal-lattice plane.*

### Solution

From Equation (1.1), the intercepts of the plane correspond to \( p = 3, q = 2, \) and \( s = 1 \). Now write the reciprocals of the intercepts, which gives

\[
\left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)
\]

Multiply by the lowest common denominator, which in this case is 6, to obtain (2, 3, 6). The plane in Figure 1.6 is then referred to as the (236) plane. The integers are referred to as the Miller indices. We will refer to a general plane as the \( (hkl) \) plane.

### Comment

We can show that the same three Miller indices are obtained for any plane that is parallel to the one shown in Figure 1.6. Any parallel plane is entirely equivalent to any other.
