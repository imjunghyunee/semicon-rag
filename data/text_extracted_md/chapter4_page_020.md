# 4.3 The Extrinsic Semiconductor

!Figure 4.9

**Figure 4.9** Density of states functions, Fermiâ€“Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole concentrations for the case when \( E_F \) is below the intrinsic Fermi energy.

The expressions previously derived for the **thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes**, given by Equations (4.11) and (4.19), are general equations for \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \) in terms of the Fermi energy. These equations are again given as

\[
n_0 = N_c \exp\left(\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT}\right)
\]

and

\[
p_0 = N_v \exp\left(\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT}\right)
\]

As we just discussed, the Fermi energy may vary through the bandgap energy, which will then change the values of \( n_0 \) and \( p_0 \).
