\[
2.5 \times 10^8 = \left\{ \frac{2(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(25)}{(11.7)(8.85 \times 10^{-14})} \left[ \frac{(2 \times 10^{17})N_d}{2 \times 10^7 + N_d} \right] \right\}^{1/2}
\]

which yields

\[
N_d = 8.43 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

## Conclusion

A smaller value of \( N_d \) results in a smaller value of \( E_{\text{max}} \) for a given reverse-biased voltage. The value of \( N_d \) determined in this example, then, is the maximum value that will meet the specifications.

## Exercise Problem

**Ex. 7.4** The maximum electric field in a reverse-biased GaAs pn junction at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) is to be limited to \( |E_{\text{max}}| = 7.2 \times 10^4 \, \text{V/cm} \). The doping concentrations are \( N_a = 5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( N_d = 3 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). Determine the maximum reverse-biased voltage that can be applied. (\( \lambda \, 1\% \, \varepsilon = \lambda \, 1\% \, \text{SUV} \))

## 7.3.2 Junction Capacitance

Since we have a separation of positive and negative charges in the depletion region, a capacitance is associated with the pn junction. Figure 7.9 shows the charge densities in the depletion region for applied reverse-biased voltages of \( V_R \) and \( V_R + dV_R \). An increase
