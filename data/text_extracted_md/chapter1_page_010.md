## 1.4 THE DIAMOND STRUCTURE

As already stated, silicon is the most common semiconductor material. **Silicon** is referred to as a group IV element and has a diamond crystal structure. **Germanium** is also a group IV element and has the same diamond structure. A unit cell of the diamond structure, shown in Figure 1.11, is more complicated than the simple cubic structures that we have considered up to this point.

We may begin to understand the diamond lattice by considering the tetrahedral structure shown in Figure 1.12. This structure is basically a body-centered cubic with four of the corner atoms missing. Every atom in the tetrahedral structure has four nearest neighbors and it is this structure that is the basic building block of the diamond lattice.
