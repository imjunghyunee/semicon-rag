# Chapter 6: Nonequilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

and

\[
p_0 + \delta p = n_i \exp \left( \frac{E_{Fi} - E_{Fp}}{kT} \right)
\]

(6.85b)

where \(E_{Fn}\) and \(E_{Fp}\) are the quasi-Fermi energy levels for electrons and holes, respectively. The total electron concentration and the total hole concentration are functions of the quasi-Fermi levels.

## Example 6.7

**Objective:** Calculate the quasi-Fermi energy levels.

Consider an n-type semiconductor at \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\) with carrier concentrations of \(n_0 = 10^5 \, \text{cm}^{-3}\), \(n_i = 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\), and \(p_0 = 10^6 \, \text{cm}^{-3}\). In nonequilibrium, assume that the excess carrier concentrations are \(\delta n = \delta p = 10^{13} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\).

### Solution

The Fermi level for thermal equilibrium can be determined from Equation (6.84a). We have

\[
E_F - E_{Fi} = kT \ln \left( \frac{n_0}{n_i} \right) = 0.2982 \, \text{eV}
\]

We can use Equation (6.85a) to determine the quasi-Fermi level for electrons in nonequilibrium. We can write

\[
E_{Fn} - E_{Fi} = kT \ln \left( \frac{n_0 + \delta n}{n_i} \right) = 0.2984 \, \text{eV}
\]

Equation (6.85b) can be used to calculate the quasi-Fermi level for holes in nonequilibrium. We can write

\[
E_{Fi} - E_{Fp} = kT \ln \left( \frac{p_0 + \delta p}{n_i} \right) = 0.179 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Comment

We may note that the quasi-Fermi level for electrons is above \(E_{Fi}\) while the quasi-Fermi level for holes is below \(E_{Fi}\).

### Exercise Problem

**Ex 6.7** Impurity concentrations of \(N_d = 3 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) and \(N_a = 10^{16} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) are added to silicon at \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\). Excess carriers are generated in the semiconductor such that the steady-state excess carrier concentrations are \(\delta n = \delta p = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\).

(a) Determine the thermal-equilibrium Fermi level with respect to the intrinsic Fermi level.  
(b) Find \(E_{Fn}\) and \(E_{Fp}\) with respect to \(E_g\).

Figure 6.15a shows the energy-band diagram with the Fermi energy level corresponding to thermal equilibrium. Figure 6.15b now shows the energy-band diagram under the nonequilibrium condition. Since the majority carrier electron concentration does not change significantly for this low-injection condition, the quasi-Fermi level for electrons is not much different from the thermal-equilibrium Fermi level.
