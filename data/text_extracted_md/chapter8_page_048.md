## REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. Sketch the energy bands in a zero-biased, reverse-biased, and forward-biased pn junction.
2. Write the boundary conditions for the excess minority carriers in a pn junction (a) under forward bias and (b) under reverse bias.
3. Sketch the steady-state minority carrier concentrations in a forward-biased pn junction.
4. Explain the procedure that is used in deriving the ideal current–voltage relationship in a pn junction diode.
5. Sketch the electron and hole currents through a forward-biased pn junction diode. Are currents near the junction primarily due to drift or diffusion? What about currents far from the junction?
6. What is the temperature dependence of the ideal reverse-saturation current?
7. What is meant by a “short” diode?
8. Explain the physical mechanism of the (a) generation current and (b) recombination current.
9. Sketch the forward-bias I–V characteristics of a pn junction diode showing the effects of recombination and high-level injection.
10. (a) Explain the physical mechanism of diffusion capacitance. (b) What is diffusion resistance?
11. If a forward-biased pn junction is switched off, explain what happens to the stored minority carriers. In which direction is the current immediately after the diode is switched off?

## PROBLEMS

[Note: In the following problems, assume \( T = 300 \, K \) and the following parameters unless otherwise stated. For silicon pn junctions: \( D_n = 25 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}, D_p = 10 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}, \tau_{n0} = 5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}, \tau_{p0} = 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \). For GaAs pn junctions: \( D_n = 205 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}, D_p = 9.8 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}, \tau_{n0} = 5 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}, \tau_{p0} = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).]

**8.1** (a) Consider an ideal pn junction diode at \( T = 300 \, K \) operating in the forward-bias region. Calculate the change in diode voltage that will cause a factor of 10 increase in current. (b) Repeat part (a) for a factor of 100 increase in current.
