or

\[
p = \hbar k

(2.25b)

Also recall that the de Broglie wavelength was given by

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{2\pi \hbar}{p}
\]
(2.26)

Combining Equations (2.25a) and (2.26), the wavelength can also be written in terms of the wave number as

\[
\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}
\]
(2.27a)

or

\[
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
\]
(2.27b)

A free particle with a well-defined energy will also have a well-defined wavelength and momentum.

The probability density function is \(\Psi(x, t)\Psi^*(x, t) = A A^*\), which is a constant independent of position. A free particle with a well-defined momentum can be found anywhere with equal probability. This result is in agreement with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in which a precise momentum implies an undefined position.

A localized free particle is defined by a wave packet, formed by a superposition of wave functions with different momentum or \(k\) values. We will not consider the wave packet here.

## 2.3.2 The Infinite Potential Well

The problem of a particle in the infinite potential well is a classic example of a bound particle. The potential \(V(x)\) as a function of position for this problem is shown in Figure 2.6. The particle is assumed to exist in region II, so the particle is contained within a finite region of space. The time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation is again given by Equation (2.13) as

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (E - V(x))\psi(x) = 0
\]
(2.13)

where \(E\) is the total energy of the particle. If \(E\) is finite, the wave function must be zero, or \(\psi(x) = 0\), in both regions I and III. A particle cannot penetrate these infinite potential barriers, so the probability of finding the particle in regions I and III is zero.

The time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation in region II, where \(V = 0\), becomes

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2} \psi(x) = 0
\]
