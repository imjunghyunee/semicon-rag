# CHAPTER 8 The pn Junction Diode

in the n region is lower than that in the p region. The total potential barrier is now larger than that for the zero-bias case. We argued in the last chapter that the increased potential barrier continues to hold back the electrons and holes so that there is still essentially no charge flow and hence essentially no current.

Figure 8.1c shows the energy-band diagram for the case when a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region. The Fermi level in the p region is now lower than that in the n region. The total potential barrier is now reduced. The smaller potential barrier means that the electric field in the depletion region is also reduced. The smaller electric field means that the electrons and holes are no longer held back in the n and p regions, respectively. There will be a diffusion of holes from the p region across the space charge region where they will flow into the n region. Similarly, there will be a diffusion of electrons from the n region across the space charge region where they will flow into the p region. The flow of charge generates a current through the pn junction.

The injection of holes into the n region means that these holes are minority carriers. Likewise, the injection of electrons into the p region means that these electrons are minority carriers. The behavior of these minority carriers is described by the ambipolar transport equations that were discussed in Chapter 6. There will be diffusion as well as recombination of excess carriers in these regions. The diffusion of carriers implies that there will be diffusion currents. The mathematical derivation of the pn junction current–voltage relationship is considered in the next section.

## 8.1.2 Ideal Current–Voltage Relationship

The ideal current–voltage relationship of a pn junction is derived on the basis of four assumptions. (The last assumption has three parts, but each part deals with current.) They are:

1. **The abrupt depletion layer approximation applies.** The space charge regions have abrupt boundaries, and the semiconductor is neutral outside of the depletion region.

2. **The Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation applies to carrier statistics.**

3. **The concepts of low injection and complete ionization apply.**

4. **The total current is a constant throughout the entire pn structure.**

   4a. The total current is a constant throughout the entire pn structure.

   4b. The individual electron and hole currents are continuous functions through the pn structure.

   4c. The individual electron and hole currents are constant throughout the depletion region.

Notation can sometimes appear to be overwhelming in the equations in this chapter. Table 8.1 lists some of the various electron and hole concentration terms that appear. Many terms have already been used in previous chapters but are repeated here for convenience.
