**TYU 5.4** The electron concentration in silicon is given by \( n(x) = 10^{15} e^{-x/L_n} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \, (x \geq 0) \) where \( L_n = 10^{-4} \, \text{cm} \). The electron diffusion coefficient is \( D_n = 25 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \). Determine the electron diffusion current density at (a) \( x = 0 \), (b) \( x = 10^{-4} \, \text{cm} \), and (c) \( x \rightarrow \infty \).

**TYU 5.5** The hole concentration in silicon varies linearly from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 0.01 \, \text{cm} \). The hole diffusion coefficient is \( D_p = 10 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \), the hole diffusion current density is \( 20 \, \text{A/cm}^2 \), and the hole concentration at \( x = 0 \) is \( p = 4 \times 10^{17} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \). What is the value of the hole concentration at \( x = 0.01 \, \text{cm} \)? (\(\uparrow\), \(\uparrow\) \( \downarrow \) \( \uparrow \) \( \downarrow \) \( \uparrow \))

## 5.3 GRADED IMPURITY DISTRIBUTION

In most cases so far, we have assumed that the semiconductor is uniformly doped. **In many semiconductor devices, however, there may be regions that are nonuniformly doped.** We will investigate how a nonuniformly doped semiconductor reaches thermal equilibrium and, from this analysis, we will derive the **Einstein relation**, which relates mobility and the diffusion coefficient.

### 5.3.1 Induced Electric Field

Consider a semiconductor that is nonuniformly doped with donor impurity atoms. If the semiconductor is in thermal equilibrium, the Fermi energy level is constant through the crystal so the energy-band diagram may qualitatively look like that shown in Figure 5.12. The doping concentration decreases as \( x \) increases in this case. There will be a diffusion of majority carrier electrons from the region of high concentration to the region of low concentration, which is in the \( +x \) direction. The flow of negative electrons leaves behind positively charged donor ions. The separation of
