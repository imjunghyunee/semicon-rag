# CHAPTER 6 Non-equilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

## TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING

**TYU 6.5**  
As a good approximation, the peak value of a normalized excess carrier concentration, given by Equation (6.70), occurs at \( x = L_{n,p} \). Assume the following parameters: \( \tau_{p0} = 5 \, \mu s \), \( D_p = 10 \, \text{cm}^2/s \), \( \mu_p = 386 \, \text{cm}^2/V \cdot s \), and \( E_0 = 10 \, \text{V/cm} \). Calculate the peak value at times of (a) \( t = 1 \, \mu s \), (b) \( t = 5 \, \mu s \), (c) \( t = 15 \, \mu s \), and (d) \( t = 25 \, \mu s \). What are the corresponding values of \( x \) for parts (a) to (d)?

\[
\text{TYU 6.5:} \quad \text{Peak value} = x \cdot \text{Equation} \cdot \text{Value}
\]

**TYU 6.6**  
The excess carrier concentration, given by Equation (6.70), is to be calculated at distances of one diffusion length away from the peak value. Using the parameters given in TYU 6.5, calculate the values of \( \delta p \) for (i) \( t = 1 \, \mu s \) at (i) \( x = 1.093 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{cm} \) and (ii) \( x = -3.21 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{cm} \); (b) \( t = 5 \, \mu s \) at (i) \( x = 2.64 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{cm} \) and (ii) \( x = 1.22 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{cm} \); (c) \( t = 15 \, \mu s \) at (i) \( x = 6.50 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{cm} \) and (ii) \( x = 5.08 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{cm} \).

## 6.3.4 Dielectric Relaxation Time Constant

We have assumed in the previous analysis that a quasi-neutrality condition exists—that is, the concentration of excess holes is balanced by an equal concentration of excess electrons. Suppose that we have a situation as shown in Figure 6.10, in which a uniform concentration of holes \( \delta p \) is suddenly injected into a portion of the surface of a semiconductor. We will instantly have a concentration of excess holes and a net positive charge density that is not balanced by a concentration of excess electrons. How is charge neutrality achieved and how fast?

There are three defining equations to be considered. Poisson’s equation is

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon} \tag{6.71}
\]

The current equation, Ohm’s law, is

\[
J = \sigma E \tag{6.72}
\]

The continuity equation, neglecting the effects of generation and recombination, is

\[
\nabla \cdot J = -\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \tag{6.73}
\]
