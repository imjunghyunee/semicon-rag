## Objective

Calculate the first three energy levels of an electron in an infinite potential well.

Consider an electron in an infinite potential well of width 5 Å.

### Solution

From Equation (2.38) we have:

\[
E_n = \frac{h^2 n^2}{2m a^2} = \frac{n^2 (1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2 \pi^2}{2(9.11 \times 10^{-31})(5 \times 10^{-10})^2} = n^2 (2.41 \times 10^{-19}) \, \text{J}
\]

or

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 (2.41 \times 10^{-19})}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = n^2 (1.51) \, \text{eV}
\]

Then,

\[
E_1 = 1.51 \, \text{eV}, \quad E_2 = 6.04 \, \text{eV}, \quad E_3 = 13.59 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Comment

This calculation shows the order of magnitude of the energy levels of a bound electron.

### EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 2.3** (a) The width of an infinite potential well is 12 Å. Determine the first three allowed energy levels (in eV) for an electron. (b) Repeat part (a) for a proton.

----

Figure 2.7a shows the first four allowed energies for the particle in the infinite potential well, and Figure 2.7b,c shows the corresponding wave functions and probability functions. We may note that as the energy increases, the probability of finding the particle at any given value of \( x \) becomes more uniform.

## 2.3.3 The Step Potential Function

Consider now a **step potential function** as shown in Figure 2.8. In the previous section, we considered a particle being confined between two potential barriers. In this example, we will assume that a flux of particles is incident on the potential barrier. We will assume that the particles are traveling in the \( +x \) direction and that they originated at \( x = -\infty \). A particularly interesting result is obtained for the case when the total energy of the particle is less than the barrier height, or \( E < V_0 \).

We again need to consider the time-independent wave equation in each of the two regions. This general equation was given in Equation (2.13) as:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (E - V(x)) \psi(x) = 0
\]

The wave equation in region I, in which \( V = 0 \), is:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi_I(x)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2} \psi_I(x) = 0
\]
