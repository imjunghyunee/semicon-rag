## The Junction Field-Effect Transistor

The Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JFET) is a separate class of field-effect transistors. The MOSFET has been considered in Chapters 10 and 11. In this chapter, we cover the physics and properties of the JFET. Although we have discussed the MOS and bipolar transistors in previous chapters, the material in this chapter only presumes a knowledge of semiconductor material properties and the characteristics of pn and Schottky barrier junctions.

As with the transistors considered in previous chapters, the JFET, in conjunction with other circuit elements, is capable of voltage gain and signal power gain. Again, the basic transistor action is the control of current at one terminal by the voltage across the other two terminals of the device.

There are two general categories of JFETs. The first is the pn junction FET, or pn JFET, and the second is the MEtal-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor, or MESFET. The pn JFET is fabricated with a pn junction and the MESFET is fabricated with a Schottky barrier rectifying junction.

### 13.0 | PREVIEW

In this chapter, we will:

- Present the geometry and discuss the basic operation of the pn JFET and MESFET devices.
- Analyze the modulation of the channel conductance of the JFET by an electric field perpendicular to the channel. The modulating electric field is induced in the space charge region of a reverse-biased pn junction or reverse-biased Schottky barrier junction.
- Derive the ideal currentâ€“voltage characteristics of the JFET in terms of the semiconductor material and geometrical properties of the device.
