# Metal–Semiconductor and Semiconductor Heterojunctions

In the preceding two chapters, we have considered the pn junction and assumed that the semiconductor material was the same throughout the structure. This type of junction is referred to as a **homojunction**. We developed the electrostatics of the junction and derived the current–voltage relationship. In this chapter, we consider the metal–semiconductor junction and the semiconductor heterojunction, in which the material on each side of the junction is not the same. These junctions can also produce diodes.

Semiconductor devices, or integrated circuits, must make contact with the outside world. This contact is made through nonrectifying metal–semiconductor junctions, or **ohmic contacts**. An ohmic contact is a low-resistance junction providing current conduction in both directions. We examine in this chapter the conditions that yield metal–semiconductor ohmic contacts.

## 9.0 | PREVIEW

In this chapter, we will:

- Determine the energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor junction.
- Investigate the electrostatics of the rectifying metal–semiconductor junction, which is known as the Schottky barrier diode.
- Derive the ideal current–voltage relation of the Schottky barrier diode.
- Discuss differences in the current transport mechanism between the Schottky barrier diode and pn junction diode, and discuss differences in turn-on voltage and switching times.
- Discuss ohmic contacts, which are low-resistance, nonrectifying metal–semiconductor junctions.
- Investigate the characteristics of a semiconductor heterojunction.
