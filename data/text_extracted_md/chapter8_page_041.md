If the current \( I_R \) were smaller than this value, there would be a reverse-biased voltage across the junction, which means that the junction voltage would have changed instantaneously. Since the reverse current is limited to the value given by Equation (8.108), the reverse-biased density gradient is constant; thus, the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge decrease with time as shown in Figure 8.25b.

This reverse current \( I_R \) will be approximately constant for \( 0^+ \leq t \leq t_s \), where \( t_s \) is called the storage time. The storage time is the length of time required for the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge to reach the thermal-equilibrium values. After this time, the voltage across the junction will begin to change. The current characteristic is shown in Figure 8.26. The reverse current is the flow of the stored minority carrier charge, which is the difference between the minority carrier concentrations at \( t = 0^- \) and \( t = \infty \), as shown in Figure 8.25b.
