Usually positive, may exist in the insulator. The positive charge has been identified with broken or dangling covalent bonds near the oxide–semiconductor interface. During the thermal formation of SiO₂, oxygen diffuses through the oxide and reacts near the Si–SiO₂ interface to form the SiO₂. Silicon atoms may also break away from the silicon material just prior to reacting to form SiO₂. When the oxidation process is terminated, excess silicon may exist in the oxide near the interface, resulting in the dangling bonds. The magnitude of this oxide charge seems, in general, to be a strong function of the oxidizing conditions such as oxidizing ambient and temperature. The charge density can be altered to some degree by annealing the oxide in an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. However, the charge is rarely zero.

The net fixed charge in the oxide appears to be located fairly close to the oxide–semiconductor interface. We will assume in the analysis of the MOS structure that an equivalent trapped charge per unit area, \( Q_{\text{ox}}' \), is located in the oxide directly adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. For the moment, we will ignore any other oxide-type charges that may exist in the device. The parameter \( Q_{\text{ox}}' \) is usually given in terms of number of electronic charges per unit area.

Equation (10.14), for zero applied gate voltage, can be written as

\[
V_{\text{ox0}} + \phi_{\text{ox}} = -\phi_{\text{ms}}
\]

(10.19)

If a gate voltage is applied, the potential drop across the oxide and the surface potential will change. We can then write

\[
V_G = \Delta V_{\text{ox}} + \Delta \phi_s = (V_{\text{ox}} - V_{\text{ox0}}) + (\phi_s - \phi_{\text{ox}})
\]

(10.20)

Using Equation (10.19), we have

\[
V_G = V_{\text{ox}} + \phi_s + \phi_{\text{ms}}
\]

(10.21)

Figure 10.18 shows the charge distribution in the MOS structure for the flat-band condition. There is zero net charge in the semiconductor, and we can assume that an equivalent fixed surface charge density exists in the oxide. The charge density on the metal is \( Q_m' \), and from charge neutrality we have

\[
Q_m' + Q_{\text{ox}}' = 0
\]

(10.22)

We can relate \( Q_{\text{ox}}' \) to the voltage across the oxide by

\[
V_{\text{ox}} = \frac{Q_{\text{ox}}'}{C_{\text{ox}}}
\]
