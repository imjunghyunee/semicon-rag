### Section 14.1 Optical Absorption

**14.1** Determine the maximum wavelength \(\lambda\) of a light source that can generate electron-hole pairs in (a) Si, (b) Ge, (c) GaAs, and (d) InP.

**14.2** 
(a) Two sources generate light at wavelengths of \(\lambda = 480 \, \text{nm}\) and \(\lambda = 725 \, \text{nm}\), respectively. What are the corresponding photon energies?  
(b) Three sources generate light with photon energies of \(E = 0.87 \, \text{eV}, E = 1.32 \, \text{eV},\) and \(E = 1.90 \, \text{eV}\), respectively. What are the corresponding wavelengths?

**14.3** 
(a) A sample of GaAs is \(1.2 \, \mu \text{m}\) thick. The sample is illuminated with a light source that generates photons with energies of \(h\nu = 1.65 \, \text{eV}\). Determine the (i) absorption coefficient and (ii) fraction of energy that is absorbed in the material.  
(b) Repeat part (a) for a sample of GaAs that is \(0.80 \, \mu \text{m}\) thick and is illuminated with photons with energies of \(h\nu = 1.90 \, \text{eV}\).

**14.4** A light source with \(h\nu = 1.3 \, \text{eV}\) and at a power density of \(10^{-2} \, \text{W/cm}^2\) is incident on a thin slab of silicon. The excess minority carrier lifetime is \(10^{-6} \, \text{s}\). Determine the electron-hole generation rate and the steady-state excess carrier concentration. Neglect surface effects.

**14.5** An n-type GaAs sample has a minority carrier lifetime of \(\tau_p = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}\). Incident photons with energies \(h\nu = 1.65 \, \text{eV}\) generate an excess carrier concentration of \(\delta p = 5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\) at the surface of the semiconductor.

(b) At what distance in the semiconductor does the generation rate drop to 10 percent of that at the surface?

**14.6** Consider a silicon semiconductor that is illuminated with photons with energies \(h\nu = 1.40 \, \text{eV}\).  
(a) Determine the thickness of the material such that 90 percent of the energy is absorbed.  
(b) Determine the thickness of the material such that 30 percent of the energy is transmitted through the material.

**14.7** If the thickness of a GaAs semiconductor is \(1 \, \mu \text{m}\) and 50 percent of the incident monochromatic photon energy is absorbed, determine the incident photon energy and wavelength.

**14.8** Consider monochromatic light at an intensity \(I_0\) incident on the surface at \(x = 0\) of an n-type semiconductor that extends to \(x = \infty\). Assume the electric field is zero in the semiconductor and assume a surface recombination velocity, \(s\). Taking into account...
