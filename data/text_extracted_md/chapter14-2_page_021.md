When a forward-bias current is applied to the pn junction, spontaneous emission will initially occur. The spontaneous emission spectrum is relatively broadband and is superimposed on the possible lasing modes as shown in Figure 14.35b. In order for lasing to be initiated, the spontaneous emission gain must be larger than the optical losses. By positive feedback in the cavity, lasing can occur at several specific wavelengths as indicated in Figure 14.35c.

## 14.6.3 Threshold Current

The optical intensity in the device can be written from Equation (14.65) as

\[
I_{\nu} \propto e^{\gamma(\nu)x}
\]

where \(\gamma(\nu)\) is the amplification factor. We have two basic loss mechanisms. The first is the photon absorption in the semiconductor material. We can write

\[
I_{\nu} \propto e^{-\alpha(\nu)x} \tag{14.68}
\]

where \(\alpha(\nu)\) is the absorption coefficient. The second loss mechanism is due to the partial transmission of the optical signal through the ends, or through the partially reflecting mirrors.
