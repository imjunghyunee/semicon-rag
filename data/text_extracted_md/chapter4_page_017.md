# The Semiconductor in Equilibrium

Using the velocity \( v \) from Equation (4.28) and the radius \( r_n \) from Equation (4.29), the kinetic energy becomes

\[
T = \frac{m^* e^4}{2(n\hbar)^2(4\pi \varepsilon)^2}
\]

(4.35)

The potential energy is

\[
V = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon} = -\frac{m^* e^4}{(n\hbar)^2(4\pi \varepsilon)^2}
\]

(4.36)

The total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, so that

\[
E = T + V = -\frac{m^* e^4}{2(n\hbar)^2(4\pi \varepsilon)^2}
\]

(4.37)

For the hydrogen atom, \( m^* = m_0 \) and \( \varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \). The ionization energy of the hydrogen atom in the lowest energy state is then \( E = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \). If we consider silicon, the ionization energy is \( E = -25.8 \, \text{meV} \), much less than the bandgap energy of silicon. This energy is the approximate ionization energy of the donor atom, or the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band.

For ordinary donor impurities such as phosphorus or arsenic in silicon or germanium, this hydrogenic model works quite well and gives some indication of the magnitudes of the ionization energies involved. Table 4.3 lists the actual experimentally measured ionization energies for a few impurities in silicon and germanium. Germanium and silicon have different relative dielectric constants and effective masses; thus, we expect the ionization energies to differ.

## 4.2.3 Group III–V Semiconductors

In the previous sections, we have discussed the donor and acceptor impurities in a group IV semiconductor, such as silicon. The situation in the group III–V compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, is more complicated. Group II elements, such as beryllium, zinc, and cadmium, can enter the lattice as substitutional impurities, replacing the group III gallium element to become acceptor impurities. Similarly, group VI elements, such as selenium and tellurium, can enter the lattice substitutionally, replacing the group V arsenic element to become donor impurities. The corresponding ionization energies for these impurities are smaller than those for the impurities in silicon. The ionization energies for the donors in gallium arsenide.
