## 4.1.4 The Intrinsic Fermi-Level Position

We have qualitatively argued that the Fermi energy level is located near the center of the forbidden bandgap for the intrinsic semiconductor. We can specifically calculate the intrinsic Fermi-level position. Since the electron and hole concentrations are equal, setting Equations (4.20) and (4.21) equal to each other, we have

\[
N_c \exp\left[-\frac{(E_c - E_F)}{kT}\right] = N_v \exp\left[-\frac{(E_F - E_v)}{kT}\right]
\]
