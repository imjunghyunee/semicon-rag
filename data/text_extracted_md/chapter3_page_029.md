**Figure 3.26** (a) A two-dimensional array of allowed quantum states in \( k \) space. (b) The positive one-eighth of the spherical \( k \) space.

Extrapolating the results from the one-dimensional infinite potential well, we can show (see Problem 3.23) that

\[
\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2} = k^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2 = \left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 \right) \left( \frac{\pi}{a} \right)^2
\]

(3.60)

where \( n_x, n_y, \) and \( n_z \) are positive integers. (Negative values of \( n_x, n_y, \) and \( n_z \) yield the same wave function, except for the sign, as the positive integer values, resulting in the same probability function and energy; therefore the negative integers do not represent a different quantum state.)

We can schematically plot the allowed quantum states in \( k \) space. Figure 3.26a shows a two-dimensional plot as a function of \( k_x \) and \( k_z \). Each point represents an allowed quantum state corresponding to various integral values of \( n_x \) and \( n_z \). Positive and negative values of \( k_x, k_y, \) or \( k_z \) have the same energy and represent the same energy state. Since negative values of \( k_x, k_y, \) or \( k_z \) do not represent additional quantum states, the density of quantum states will be determined by considering only the positive one-eighth of the spherical \( k \) space as shown in Figure 3.26b.

The distance between two quantum states in the \( k_x \) direction, for example, is given by

\[
k_{x,n+1} - k_{x,n} = (n_x + 1) \left( \frac{\pi}{a} \right) - n_x \left( \frac{\pi}{a} \right) = \frac{\pi}{a}
\]

(3.61)

Generalizing this result to three dimensions, the volume \( V_k \) of a single quantum state is

\[
V_k = \left( \frac{\pi}{a} \right)^3
\]

(3.62)

We can now determine the density of quantum states in \( k \) space. A differential volume in \( k \) space is shown in Figure 3.26b and is given by \( 4\pi k^2 dk \) so the differential density of quantum states in \( k \) space can be written as

\[
g_T(k) \, dk = 2 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) \frac{4\pi k^2 \, dk}{\left( \frac{\pi}{a} \right)^3}
\]
