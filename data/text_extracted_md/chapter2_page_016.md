The general solution to this equation can be written in the form

\[
\psi_I(x) = A e^{j k_1 x} + B e^{-j k_1 x} \quad (x \leq 0)
\]

(2.41)

where the constant \( k_1 \) is

\[
k_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}}
\]

(2.42)

The first term in Equation (2.41) is a traveling wave in the \( +x \) direction that represents the incident wave, and the second term is a traveling wave in the \( -x \) direction.
