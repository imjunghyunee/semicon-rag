## 15.7 | SUMMARY

- The concept of a negative differential resistance in the \( I\text{-}V \) characteristic of the tunnel diode is used in the design of a microwave tunnel diode oscillator. The expression for the maximum resistance cutoff frequency is derived.

- The operation of a microwave GUNN diode oscillator is based on the concept of negative differential mobility.

- The IMPATT diode oscillator uses injection and drift time delays to create a region of differential negative resistance.

- The power BJT has a vertical configuration and an interdigitated base–emitter surface structure. The collector drift region (doping and width) determines the rated blocking voltage of the BJT, while the base width must be sufficiently wide to avoid punch-through breakdown at the rated blocking voltage.

- A power BJT is characterized by the maximum rated collector current, maximum rated voltage, and maximum rated power dissipation. These three parameters define the SOA of the transistor.

- A power MOSFET has a vertical configuration and an interdigitated gate–source surface structure. Two specific devices considered are the DMOS and VMOS structures. The drain-drift region (doping and width) determines the rated blocking voltage of the MOSFET, while the channel length of the base (body) must be sufficiently wide to avoid punch-through breakdown at the rated blocking voltage.

- A power MOSFET is characterized by the maximum rated drain current, maximum rated voltage, and maximum rated power dissipation. These three parameters define the SOA of the transistor.
