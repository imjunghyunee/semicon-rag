!Energy-band diagram

Figure 10.9 shows the energy bands for the case in which \( \phi_s = 2\phi_p \). The Fermi level at the surface is as far above the intrinsic level as the Fermi level is below the intrinsic level in the bulk semiconductor. The electron concentration at the surface is the same as the hole concentration in the bulk material. This condition is known as the **threshold inversion point**. The applied gate voltage creating this condition is known as the **threshold voltage**. If the gate voltage increases above this threshold value, the conduction band will bend slightly closer to the Fermi level, but the change in the conduction band at the surface is now only a slight function of gate voltage. The electron concentration at the surface, however, is an exponential function of the surface potential. The surface potential may increase by a few \( (kT/e) \) volts, which will change the electron concentration by orders of magnitude, but the space charge width changes only slightly. In this case, then, the space charge region has essentially reached a maximum width.
