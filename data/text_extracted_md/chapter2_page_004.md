# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

In 1924, de Broglie postulated the existence of matter waves. He suggested that since waves exhibit particle-like behavior, particles should be expected to show wave-like properties. The hypothesis of de Broglie was the existence of a **wave-particle duality principle**. The momentum of a photon is given by

\[
p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
\]

where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the light wave. Then, de Broglie hypothesized that the wavelength of a particle can be expressed as

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \(p\) is the momentum of the particle and \(\lambda\) is known as the **de Broglie wavelength** of the matter wave.

The wave nature of electrons has been tested in several ways. In one experiment by Davisson and Germer in 1927, electrons from a heated filament were accelerated at normal incidence onto a single crystal of nickel. A detector measured the scattered electrons as a function of angle. Figure 2.2 shows the experimental setup and Figure 2.3 shows the results. The existence of a peak in the density of scattered electrons can be explained as a constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic atoms in the planes of the nickel crystal. The angular distribution is very similar to an interference pattern produced by light diffracted from a grating.

In order to gain some appreciation of the frequencies and wavelengths involved in the wave-particle duality principle, Figure 2.4 shows the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. We see that a wavelength of 72.7 Å obtained in the next example is in the ultraviolet range. Typically, we will be considering wavelengths in the
