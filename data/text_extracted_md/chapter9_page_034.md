# Chapter 9: Metal–Semiconductor and Semiconductor Heterojunctions

- The ideal current–voltage relationship of the Schottky barrier diode is the same as that of the pn junction diode. However, since the current mechanism is different from that of the pn junction diode, the switching speed of the Schottky diode is faster. In addition, the reverse saturation current of the Schottky diode is larger than that of the pn junction diode, so a Schottky diode requires less forward bias voltage to achieve a given current compared to a pn junction diode.
- Metal–semiconductor junctions can also form ohmic contacts, which are low-resistance junctions providing conduction in both directions with very little voltage drop across the junction.
- Semiconductor heterojunctions are formed between two semiconductor materials with different bandgap energies. One useful property of a heterojunction is the creation of a potential well at the interface. Electrons are confined to the potential well in the direction perpendicular to the interface, but are free to move in the other two directions.

## Glossary of Important Terms

- **anisotype junction**: A heterojunction in which the type of dopant changes at the metallurgical junction.
- **electron affinity rule**: The rule stating that, in an ideal heterojunction, the discontinuity at the conduction band is the difference between the electron affinities in the two semiconductors.
- **heterojunction**: The junction formed by the contact between two different semiconductor materials.
- **image force–induced lowering**: The lowering of the peak potential barrier at the metal–semiconductor junction due to an electric field.
- **isotype junction**: A heterojunction in which the type of dopant is the same on both sides of the junction.
- **ohmic contact**: A low-resistance metal–semiconductor contact providing conduction in both directions between the metal and semiconductor.
- **Richardson constant**: The parameter \( A^* \) in the current–voltage relation of a Schottky diode.
- **Schottky barrier height**: The potential barrier \( \phi_{bn} \) from the metal to semiconductor in a metal–semiconductor junction.
- **Schottky effect**: Another term for image force–induced lowering.
- **specific contact resistance**: The inverse of the slope of the \( J \) versus \( V \) curve of a metal–semiconductor contact evaluated at \( V = 0 \).
- **thermionic emission**: The process by which charge flows over a potential barrier as a result of carriers with sufficient thermal energy.
- **tunneling barrier**: A thin potential barrier in which the current is dominated by the tunneling of carriers through the barrier.
- **two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG)**: The accumulation layer of electrons contained in a potential well at a heterojunction interface. The electrons are free to move in the “other” two spatial directions.
