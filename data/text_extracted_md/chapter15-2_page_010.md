One particular gate control situation is shown in Figure 15.38b. Terminal 1 is positive with respect to terminal 2, and a negative gate voltage is applied with respect to terminal 1, so the gate current is negative. This polarity arrangement induces the current \( I_1 \) and the junction \( J_4 \) becomes forward biased. Electrons are injected from \( n_3 \), diffuse across \( p_2 \), and are collected in the \( n_1 \) region. In this case \( n_3p_2n_1 \) behaves like a saturated transistor. The collected electrons in \( n_1 \) lower the potential of \( n_1 \) with respect to \( p_2 \). The current across the \( p_2n_1 \) junction increases, which can trigger the \( p_2n_1p_1n_3 \) thyristor into its conducting mode.

We can show that the other combinations of gate, anode, and cathode voltages will also trigger the triac into conduction. Figure 15.39 shows the terminal characteristics.
