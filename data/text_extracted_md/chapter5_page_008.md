If these two scattering processes are independent, then the total probability of a scattering event occurring in the differential time \( dt \) is the sum of the individual events, or

\[
\frac{dt}{\tau} = \frac{dt}{\tau_i} + \frac{dt}{\tau_L}
\]

(5.17)

where \( \tau \) is the mean time between any scattering event.

Comparing Equation (5.17) with the definitions of mobility given by Equation (5.13) or (5.14), we can write

\[
\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{\mu_i} + \frac{1}{\mu_L}
\]

(5.18)

where \( \mu_i \) is the mobility due to the ionized impurity scattering process and \( \mu_L \) is the mobility due to the lattice scattering process. The parameter \( \mu \) is the net mobility. With two or more independent scattering mechanisms, the inverse mobilities add, which means that the net mobility decreases.
