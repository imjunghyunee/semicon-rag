material, and excess carriers generated within one diffusion length of the junction will be collected. If \( E_{gV} \) is large enough, then the high-energy photons will be absorbed in the space charge region of the narrow-bandgap material. This heterojunction solar cell should have better characteristics than a homojunction cell, especially at the shorter wavelengths.

A variation of the heterojunction is shown in Figure 14.13. A pn homojunction is formed and then a wide-bandgap material is grown on top. Again, the wide-bandgap material acts as an optical window for photon energies \( h\nu < E_{gL} \). Photons with energies \( E_{gL} < h\nu < E_{gH} \) will create excess carriers in the homojunction and photons with energies \( h\nu > E_{gH} \) will create excess carriers in the window type material. If the absorption coefficient in the narrow bandgap material is high, then essentially all of the excess carriers will be generated within a diffusion length of the junction, so the collection efficiency will be very high. Figure 14.13 also shows the normalized spectral response for various mole fractions \( x \) in the Al\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)As.

### 14.2.5 Amorphous Silicon Solar Cells

Single-crystal silicon solar cells tend to be expensive and are limited to approximately 6 inches in diameter. A system powered by solar cells requires, in general,
