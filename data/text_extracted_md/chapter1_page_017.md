# 1.7 Growth of Semiconductor Materials

Lattice-displacement damage. However, most of the lattice damage can be removed by thermal annealing, in which the temperature of the crystal is raised for a short time. Thermal annealing is a required step after implantation.

## 1.7.1 Growth of Semiconductor Materials

The success in fabricating very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is a result, to a large extent, of the development of and improvement in the formation or growth of pure single-crystal semiconductor materials. Semiconductors are some of the purest materials. Silicon, for example, has concentrations of most impurities of less than 1 part in \(10^{10}\) atoms. The high purity requirement means that extreme care is necessary in the growth and the treatment of the material at each step of the fabrication process. The mechanics and kinetics of crystal growth are extremely complex and will be described in only very general terms in this text. However, a general knowledge of the growth techniques and terminology is valuable.

### 1.7.1 Growth from a Melt

A common technique for growing single-crystal materials is called the **Czochralski method**. In this technique, a small piece of single-crystal material, known as a seed, is brought into contact with the surface of the same material in liquid phase, and then slowly pulled from the melt. As the seed is slowly pulled, solidification occurs along the plane between the solid–liquid interface. Usually the crystal is also rotated slowly as it is being pulled, to provide a slight stirring action to the melt, resulting in a more uniform temperature. Controlled amounts of specific impurity atoms, such as boron or phosphorus, may be added to the melt so that the grown semiconductor crystal is intentionally doped with the impurity atom. Figure 1.21a shows a schematic of the Czochralski growth process and a silicon ingot or boule grown by this process.

Some impurities may be present in the ingot that are undesirable. Zone refining is a common technique for purifying material. A high-temperature coil, or r-f induction coil, is slowly passed along the length of the boule. The temperature induced by the coil is high enough so that a thin layer of liquid is formed. At the solid–liquid interface, there is a distribution of impurities between the two phases. The parameter that describes this distribution is called the **segregation coefficient**: the ratio of the concentration of impurities in the solid to the concentration in the liquid. If the segregation coefficient is 0.1, for example, the concentration of impurities in the liquid is a factor of 10 greater than that in the solid. As the liquid zone moves through the material, the impurities are driven along with the liquid. After several passes of the r-f coil, most impurities are at the end of the bar, which can then be cut off. The moving molten zone, or the zone-refining technique, can result in considerable purification.

After the semiconductor is grown, the boule is mechanically trimmed to the proper diameter and a flat is ground over the entire length of the boule to denote
