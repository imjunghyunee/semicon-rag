and

\[
R_{nr} = \frac{\delta n}{\tau_{nr}}
\]

(14.56b)

where \(\tau_r\) and \(\tau_{nr}\) are the radiative and nonradiative recombination lifetimes, respectively, and \(\delta n\) is the excess carrier concentration. The total recombination rate is

\[
R = R_r + R_{nr} = \frac{\delta n}{\tau} = \frac{\delta n}{\tau_r} + \frac{\delta n}{\tau_{nr}}
\]

(14.57)

where \(\tau\) is the net excess carrier lifetime.

The radiative efficiency is defined as the fraction of recombinations that are radiative. We can write

\[
\eta = \frac{R_r}{R_r + R_{nr}} = \frac{1}{\frac{\tau}{\tau_r} + \frac{\tau}{\tau_{nr}}} = \frac{\tau_r}{\tau}
\]

(14.58)

where \(\eta\) is the radiative efficiency. The nonradiative recombination rate is proportional to \(N_t\), which is the density of nonradiative trapping sites within the forbidden bandgap. Obviously, the radiative efficiency increases as \(N_t\) is reduced.

The internal quantum efficiency is now written as

\[
\eta_i = \eta \eta
\]

(14.59)

The radiative recombination rate is proportional to the p-type doping. As the p-type doping increases, the radiative recombination rate increases. However, the injection efficiency decreases as the p-type doping increases; therefore, there is an optimum doping that maximizes the internal quantum efficiency.

## 14.5.3 External Quantum Efficiency

One very important parameter of the LED is the **external quantum efficiency**: the fraction of generated photons that are actually emitted from the semiconductor. The external quantum efficiency is normally a much smaller number than the internal quantum efficiency. Once a photon has been produced in the semiconductor, there are three loss mechanisms the photon may encounter: photon absorption within the semiconductor, Fresnel loss, and critical angle loss.

Figure 14.25 shows a pn junction LED. Photons can be emitted in any direction. Since the emitted photon energy must be \(h\nu \geq E_g\), these emitted photons can be reabsorbed within the semiconductor material. The majority of photons will actually be emitted away from the surface and reabsorbed in the semiconductor.

Photons must be emitted from the semiconductor into air; thus, the photons must be transmitted across a dielectric interface. Figure 14.26 shows the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The parameter \(n_2\) is the index of refraction for the semiconductor and \(n_1\) is the index of refraction for air. The reflection coefficient is

\[
\Gamma = \left( \frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 + n_1} \right)^2
\]

(14.60)

This effect is called Fresnel loss. The reflection coefficient \(\Gamma\) is the fraction of incident photons that are reflected back into the semiconductor.
