# Fundamentals of the Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor

that is used extensively, for which the basic fabrication techniques must be considered in order to understand essential characteristics of these devices and circuits. The MOS technology we consider briefly is the complementary MOS, or CMOS, process.

We have considered the physics of both n-channel and p-channel enhancement mode MOSFETs. Both devices are used in a CMOS inverter, which is the basis of CMOS digital logic circuits. The dc power dissipation in a digital circuit can be reduced to very low levels by using a complementary p-channel and n-channel pair.

It is necessary to form electrically isolated p- and n-substrate regions in an integrated circuit to accommodate the n- and p-channel transistors. The p-well process has been a commonly used technique for CMOS circuits. The process starts with a fairly low doped n-type silicon substrate in which the p-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. A diffused p region, called a p well, is formed in which the n-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. In most cases, the p-type substrate doping level must be larger than the n-type substrate doping level to obtain the desired threshold voltages. The larger p doping can easily compensate the initial n doping to form the p well. A simplified cross section of the p-well CMOS structure is shown in Figure 10.58a. The notation FOX stands for field oxide, which is a relatively thick oxide separating the devices. The FOX prevents either the n or p substrate from becoming inverted and helps maintain isolation between the two devices. In practice, additional processing steps must be included; for example, providing connections so that the p well and n substrate can be electrically connected to the appropriate voltages. The n substrate
