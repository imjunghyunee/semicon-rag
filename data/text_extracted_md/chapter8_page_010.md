Figure 8.6 shows the quasi-Fermi levels through the pn junction. From Equations (8.14) and (8.15), the carrier concentrations are exponential functions of distance, and from Equations (8.16) and (8.17), the carrier concentrations are exponential functions of the quasi-Fermi levels. The quasi-Fermi levels are then linear functions of distance in the neutral p and n regions as shown in Figure 8.6.

We may note that close to the space charge edge in the p region, \(E_{Fn} - E_{Fi} > 0\) which means that \(\delta n > n_i\). Further from the space charge edge, \(E_{Fn} - E_{Fi} < 0\) which means that \(\delta n < n_i\) and the excess electron concentration is approaching zero. The same discussion applies to the excess hole concentration in the n region.

At the space charge edge at \(x = x_n\), we can write, for low injection

\[
n_e p_e (x_n) = n_e p_{e0} \exp\left(\frac{V_a}{V_t}\right) = n_i^2 \exp\left(\frac{V_a}{V_t}\right)
\]
