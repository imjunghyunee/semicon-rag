## 14.6.2 Optical Cavity

Population inversion is one requirement for lasing action to occur. Coherent emission output is achieved by using an optical cavity. The cavity will cause a buildup of the optical intensity from positive feedback. A resonant cavity consisting of two parallel mirrors is known as a Fabryâ€“Perot resonator. The resonant cavity can be fabricated, for example, by cleaving a gallium arsenide crystal along the (110) planes as shown in Figure 14.34. The optical wave propagates through the junction in the z direction, bouncing back and forth between the end mirrors. The mirrors are actually only partially reflecting so that a portion of the optical wave will be transmitted out of the junction.

For resonance, the length of the cavity \( L \) must be an integral number of half wavelengths, or

\[
N \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right) = L
\]

(14.67)

where \( N \) is an integer. Since \( \lambda \) is small and \( L \) is relatively large, there can be many resonant modes in the cavity. Figure 14.35a shows the resonant modes as a function of wavelength.
