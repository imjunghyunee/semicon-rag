# Chapter 7: The pn Junction

**Figure 7.15** | Breakdown voltage versus impurity concentration in uniformly doped and linearly graded junctions. (From Sze [14].)

For a doping concentration of \(4 \times 10^{15} \, \text{cm}^{-3}\), the critical electric field, from Figure 7.14, is approximately \(3.7 \times 10^5 \, \text{V/cm}\). Then, using Equation (7.61), we find the breakdown voltage as

\[
V_b = \frac{\varepsilon_c E_{\text{crit}}^2}{2eN_d} = \frac{(11.7)(8.85 \times 10^{-14})(3.7 \times 10^5)^2}{2(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(4 \times 10^{15})} = 110 \, \text{V}
\]

which correlates very well with the results from Figure 7.15.

## Conclusion

As Figure 7.15 shows, the breakdown voltage increases as the doping concentration decreases in the low-doped region.

## Exercise Problem

**Ex. 7.7** A one-sided, planar, uniformly doped silicon pn junction diode is required to have a reverse-biased breakdown voltage of \(V_b = 60 \, \text{V}\). What is the maximum doping concentration in the low-doped region such that this specification is met?

# 7.5 Nonuniformly Doped Junctions

In the pn junctions considered so far, we have assumed that each semiconductor region has been uniformly doped. In actual pn junction structures, this is rarely true. In some electronic applications, specific nonuniform doping profiles are used to obtain special pn junction capacitance characteristics.
