A very thin layer of amorphous silicon is required for a solar cell. A typical amorphous silicon solar cell is a PIN device shown in Figure 14.15. The amorphous silicon is deposited on an optically transparent indium tin oxide–coated glass substrate. If aluminum is used as the back contact, it will reflect any transmitted photons back through the PIN device. The n⁺ and p⁺ regions can be quite thin while the intrinsic region may be in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 μm thick. The energy-band diagram for the thermal equilibrium case is shown in the figure. Excess carriers generated in the intrinsic region are separated by the electric field and produce the photocurrent, as we have discussed. Conversion efficiencies are smaller than in single-crystal silicon, but the reduced cost makes this technology attractive. Amorphous silicon solar cells approximately 40 cm wide and many meters long have been fabricated.
