# Chapter 6: Nonequilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors

### Key Terms

- **ambipolar transport equation**: The equation describing the behavior of excess carriers as a function of time and space coordinates.

- **carrier generation**: The process of elevating electrons from the valence band into the conduction band, creating an electron–hole pair.

- **carrier recombination**: The process whereby an electron “falls” into an empty state in the valence band (a hole) so that an electron–hole pair is annihilated.

- **excess carriers**: The term describing both excess electrons and excess holes.

- **excess electrons**: The concentration of electrons in the conduction band over and above the thermal-equilibrium concentration.

- **excess holes**: The concentration of holes in the valence band over and above the thermal-equilibrium concentration.

- **excess minority carrier lifetime**: The average time that an excess minority carrier exists before it recombines.

- **generation rate**: The rate (#/cm\(^3\)·s) at which electron–hole pairs are created.

- **low-level injection**: The condition in which the excess carrier concentration is much smaller than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentration.

- **minority carrier diffusion length**: The average distance a minority carrier diffuses before recombining; a parameter equal to \(\sqrt{D \tau}\) where \(D\) and \(\tau\) are the minority carrier diffusion coefficient and lifetime, respectively.

- **quasi-Fermi level**: The quasi-Fermi level for electrons and the quasi-Fermi level for holes relate the nonequilibrium electron and hole concentrations, respectively, to the intrinsic carrier concentration and the intrinsic Fermi level.

- **recombination rate**: The rate (#/cm\(^3\)·s) at which electron–hole pairs recombine.

- **surface recombination velocity**: A parameter that relates the gradient of the excess carrier concentration at a surface to the surface concentration of excess carriers.

- **surface states**: The electronic energy states that exist within the bandgap at a semiconductor surface.
