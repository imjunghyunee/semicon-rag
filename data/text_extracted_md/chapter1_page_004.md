A **primitive cell** is the smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form the lattice. In many cases, it is more convenient to use a unit cell that is not a primitive cell. Unit cells may be chosen that have orthogonal sides, for example, whereas the sides of a primitive cell may be nonorthogonal.

A generalized three-dimensional unit cell is shown in Figure 1.4. The relationship between this cell and the lattice is characterized by three vectors **a**, **b**, and **c**, which need not be perpendicular and which may or may not be equal in length. Every equivalent lattice point in the three-dimensional crystal can be found using the vector

\[
\vec{r} = p\vec{a} + q\vec{b} + s\vec{c}
\]

where \( p, q, \) and \( s \) are integers. Since the location of the origin is arbitrary, we will let \( p, q, \) and \( s \) be positive integers for simplicity. The magnitudes of the vectors **a**, **b**, and **c** are the lattice constants of the unit cell.

## 1.3.2 Basic Crystal Structures

Before we discuss the semiconductor crystal, let us consider three crystal structures and determine some of the basic characteristics of these crystals. Figure 1.5 shows the simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic structures. For these simple structures, we may choose unit cells such that the general vectors **a**, **b**, and **c**
