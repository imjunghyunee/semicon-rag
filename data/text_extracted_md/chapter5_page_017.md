## 5.2 | CARRIER DIFFUSION

There is a second mechanism, in addition to drift, that can induce a current in a semiconductor. We may consider a classic physics example in which a container, as shown in Figure 5.9, is divided into two parts by a membrane. The left side contains gas molecules at a particular temperature and the right side is initially empty. The gas molecules are in continual random thermal motion so that, when the membrane is broken, the gas molecules flow into the right side of the container. **Diffusion is the process whereby particles flow from a region of high concentration toward a region of low concentration.** If the gas molecules were electrically charged, the net flow of charge would result in a diffusion current.

### 5.2.1 Diffusion Current Density

To begin to understand the diffusion process in a semiconductor, we will consider a simplified analysis. Assume that an electron concentration varies in one dimension as shown in Figure 5.10. The temperature is assumed to be uniform so that the average thermal velocity of electrons is independent of \( x \). To calculate the current, we will determine the net flow of electrons per unit time per unit area crossing the plane at \( x = 0 \). If the distance \( l \) shown in Figure 5.10 is less than the mean-free path of an electron, that is, the average
